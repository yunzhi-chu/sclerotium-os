# OpenClaw Marketing Skills

A collection of 37 battle-tested marketing skills for OpenClaw agents.

## Getting Started

**Start here:** Use `product-marketing-context` to create `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`. All other skills automatically reference this — describe your product once, never repeat yourself.

## Skills Included

See the individual skill folders in `skills/` for full documentation.

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| Foundation | product-marketing-context |
| CRO | page-cro, signup-flow-cro, onboarding-cro, form-cro, popup-cro, paywall-upgrade-cro |
| Copy & Content | copywriting, copy-editing, cold-email, email-sequence, social-content |
| SEO | seo-audit, ai-seo, programmatic-seo, site-architecture, schema-markup, content-strategy |
| Paid & Analytics | paid-ads, ad-creative, ab-test-setup, analytics-tracking |
| **Data Connectors** | **google-ads-connect, search-console-connect, meta-ads-connect, x-twitter-connect** |
| Growth & Retention | referral-program, free-tool-strategy, churn-prevention |
| Sales & GTM | revops, sales-enablement, launch-strategy, pricing-strategy, competitor-alternatives |
| Strategy | marketing-ideas, marketing-psychology, lead-magnets |

## Usage

Just ask naturally:

- "Optimize this landing page for conversions" → page-cro
- "Write homepage copy for my SaaS" → copywriting
- "Audit our SEO" → seo-audit
- "Create a 5-email welcome sequence" → email-sequence
- "Help me with Google Ads" → paid-ads
- "Audit my Google Ads account with real data" → google-ads-connect
- "Why did my organic traffic drop?" → search-console-connect
- "Find creative fatigue in my Meta ads" → meta-ads-connect
- "Find X/Twitter conversations we should answer" → x-twitter-connect

**Data Connectors** give skills access to real account data and public social signals — turning strategy advice into data-driven execution. Connect once, all related skills get smarter automatically.

## Optional X/Twitter Execution

When `social-content`, `paid-ads`, `launch-strategy`, or `competitor-alternatives` need live X/Twitter data or approval-gated actions, install TweetClaw:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @xquik/tweetclaw
```

Use TweetClaw for tweet search, reply search, follower export, user lookup, monitors, webhooks, giveaway draws, and approval-gated posts or replies.
