## New in Version 1.0.2

### 📚 Material-First Teaching

**Before teaching, the skill now requires:**
1. Request learning material from user (PDF, textbook, etc.)
2. Read and analyze the material thoroughly
3. Cross-reference with knowledge base and search online
4. Build complete understanding before starting lessons

**Why?** To teach accurately, not from vague memory.

### 🧠 Memory Tracking System

**Automatically records:**
- Completed concepts with mastery status (✅ Mastered / ⚠️ Review / ❌ Not Yet)
- Error log with mistakes and correct understanding
- Chapter progress and review completion
- Weak points that need more practice
- Next session resume point

**When memory is updated:**
- After each concept taught
- After each check question
- After each chapter completion
- After chapter review
- Every 5-10 exchanges (catch-up)
- End of session

**Benefits:**
- Never repeat what user has already mastered
- Track weak points for targeted review
- Resume exactly where left off
- Build long-term learning history

### 📁 Dedicated Study File

**Writes to:** `memory/[Subject-Name]-study.md`

**Examples:**
- `memory/Data-Structures-study.md`
- `memory/Computer-Organization-study.md`
- `memory/Calculus-study.md`

**Why separate file?**
- Reduce token consumption (don't load entire MEMORY.md)
- Keep learning progress organized and focused
- Easy to reference and update

### 📅 Smart Session Resume

**When user returns after a break:**

```
Welcome back! 👋

Last session was [X days ago]. You had completed:
- [List of completed concepts/chapters]

**How would you like to start today?**

1️⃣ Continue directly — Pick up where you left off

2️⃣ Review first — Warm up with:
   - Yesterday's content
   - 3 days ago content (spaced repetition)
   - Your weak points
```

**Review includes:**
- Yesterday's studied concepts
- Content from 3 days ago (spaced repetition)
- All weak points from error log

---

## New in Version 1.0.1

### 🔄 Chapter Review Mechanism

After completing a chapter, users get a structured review session:

```
## Chapter Review: [Chapter Name]

### 📋 Chapter Map
Quick overview of all concepts covered

### 🔑 Core Formulas
All must-memorize formulas in one place

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes Recap
Reminders of traps encountered during learning

### 📝 Review Questions
3-5 comprehensive questions (easy → hard)

### ✅ Review Complete!
Summary of mastered concepts and areas to revisit
```

### 💬 Expanded Tone Library

**30+ pre-written phrases for every situation:**

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| User answers correctly | "对！就是这个思路！" / "Perfect! You've got it!" |
| User answers incorrectly | "接近了！再想想 XX 这个条件" / "So close! Just think about [X] again" |
| User is confused | "我换个说法试试..." / "Let me try explaining it differently..." |
| User is frustrated | "这个地方确实有难度，不是你理解力的问题" / "This is genuinely tricky" |
| Celebrating progress | "已经学了一半了！状态不错" / "Halfway through! You're doing great" |
| Time management | "慢慢来，不着急～" / "Take your time, no rush～" |

## Usage Example

### User Input
```
I want to learn Chapter 1 of Computer Organization
```

### Skill Response
```
Great, I'll help you with Chapter 1.

Before we start, let me understand:

1. **Learning Goal** — Is this for an exam or self-study? What's your target score?
2. **Current Level** — Have you studied this before? What felt unclear?
3. **Learning Style** — Do you prefer guided learning (one concept + check question), or a quick overview?

---

**Default Learning Flow:**

1. 📌 One core concept at a time, with priority labels
2. 📖 Real-life analogies for understanding
3. 📝 Formulas and exam tips after each concept
4. ❓ A check question to confirm understanding
5. ✅ Move on after correct answer
6. 🔄 After the chapter, a review session to reinforce everything
