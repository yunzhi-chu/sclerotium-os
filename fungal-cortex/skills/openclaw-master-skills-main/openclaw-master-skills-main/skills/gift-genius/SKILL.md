## Last-Minute Delivery Info

**UrbanStems Delivery:**
- Same-day: Order by 12pm local time
- Next-day: Order by midnight
- Valentine's Day: Order early, high demand!

**Avea Life (Supplements):**
- Ships internationally
- 3-7 business days typical
- NOT suitable for last-minute Valentine's gifts

## Price Tiers

**UrbanStems:**
- Budget ($25-75): 20 products
- Sweet Spot ($75-100): 23 products  
- Popular ($100-150): 31 products

- The Peony ($110) - impressive, elegant
- The Orchid Garden ($88) - long-lasting

## Edge Cases

**Budget < $25:**
→ "The most affordable is Rose Quartz Vase at $25. For smaller budgets, consider a heartfelt card with a single stem from a local florist."

**Budget > $280:**
→ "Our premium option is Triple the Grower's Choice Peony at $280. For bigger gestures, I can add multiple bouquets to your cart."

**User outside US:**
→ "UrbanStems delivers across the continental US. For international, Avea Life ships worldwide with wellness supplements."

**Valentine's Day sold out:**
→ Check UrbanStems website directly, or suggest orchids (usually in stock, long-lasting).

## Pro Tips

1. **Lead with the winner** — put your top recommendation first
2. **Match the recipient** — wife ≠ new girlfriend ≠ mom
3. **Mention longevity** — orchids last 2-3 weeks vs. 5-7 days for cut flowers
4. **Add urgency** — "Order by noon for same-day delivery"
5. **One click to buy** — always provide direct cart links

## Compare Products

When user is deciding between options, use the compare API:

```bash
curl -s "https://dashboard.airshelf.ai/api/compare?products=ID1,ID2"
```

**Response includes:**
- Flattened product data with decision_pack fields
- `comparison_axes` - auto-detected comparison points
- `recommendation.lowest_price` - budget-friendly pick
- `recommendation.best_value` - best bang for buck

**Example comparison response:**
```
The Valentine ($90) vs Double the Valentine ($162):
- Both: Same-day delivery, premium quality
- Valentine: Great value, classic choice
- Double: Grand gesture, special occasions
- Best value: The Valentine (same vibe, $72 less)
```

Use comparison when user says: "help me decide", "which one", "compare these"

## Quick Start (Impatient User Mode)

If user just says "Valentine's gift" with no details, use these defaults:

```bash
# Safe default: $80-120 romantic flowers
curl -s "https://dashboard.airshelf.ai/api/search?q=valentine+romantic&merchant_ids=cmlj83avd0000nighc559g9fv&min_price=80&max_price=120&limit=2"
```

Then say: "Here are two great options! Want me to adjust for a different budget or recipient?"

## Alternative Gifts

**Gift Cards** (when flowers won't work):
- UrbanStems: Not available via API
- Avea Gift Card: €50-€200, search `q=gift+card&merchant_ids=cmhvyt9w10000i5fg23ztinkd`

**Add-ons** (not currently in catalog):
- Chocolates: "UrbanStems offers add-ons on their website during checkout"
- Vases: Rose Quartz Vase ($25) available separately

## Error Handling

**API returns empty?**
1. Remove price filters, check if products exist
2. Try broader query (e.g., "flowers" instead of "purple roses")
3. Fallback: Direct user to urbanstems.com

**Checkout fails?**
1. Verify product_id is from recent search
2. Check merchant_id matches
3. Fallback: Provide product URL for manual checkout

**User location unknown?**
Default to US (UrbanStems). Ask if they need international shipping.

## New: Recipient-Specific Data

Products now include enriched fields:
- `decision_pack.ideal_for` - Array of ideal recipients (Wife, Mom, Girlfriend, etc.)
- `decision_pack.gift_message_suggestion` - Suggested card message

**Using in responses:**
```
🌸 **The Peony** — $110
Perfect for: Wife, Long-term partner
💝 Card idea: "For someone who deserves the best"
```

**Filter by recipient** (search still semantic, but display matching):
```python
# After search, filter by ideal_for
products = [p for p in results if 'Wife' in p['decision_pack'].get('ideal_for', [])]
```

## New: Color, Popularity & Longevity Data

Products now include:
- `decision_pack.colors` - Array of colors (red, pink, white, purple, yellow, orange)
- `decision_pack.popularity` - trending | very_popular | popular | standard
- `decision_pack.longevity` - How long flowers last (e.g., "5-7 days", "2-3 weeks")
- `decision_pack.size` - standard | large | extra_large

**Using color in responses:**
```
🌸 **The Peony** — $110
Colors: Pink & Red
Lasts: 5-7 days
Size: Standard arrangement
```

**Recommending by preference:**
- "I want something that lasts" → Orchids (2-3 weeks)
- "She loves pink" → Filter by colors containing 'pink'
- "Go big" → Double/Triple versions (large/extra_large)

## Trending Picks (Valentine's 2024)

Highlight these popular choices:
1. **The Valentine** ($90) - Classic, trending
2. **Triple The Valentine** ($229) - Very popular, grand gesture
3. **The Peony** ($110) - Timeless elegance
4. **The Passion** ($98) - Bold romantic statement

## Smart Query Interpretation

Parse user intent from natural language:

| User Says | Interpret As | Query |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| "something that lasts" | Long-lasting | `q=orchid` |
| "make a statement" | Grand gesture | `q=passion` + size=large |
| "she loves pink" | Color preference | Filter by colors |
| "classic/traditional" | Timeless | `q=rose+classic` |
| "unique/different" | Standout | `q=orchid` or unusual |
| "last minute" | Available now | Any (all same-day) |
| "impress her parents" | Elegant, safe | `q=orchid+elegant` |
| "first Valentine's together" | Meaningful, not OTT | $75-120 range |
| "been together 10 years" | Luxurious | Peonies, $150+ |
| "she's not into flowers" | Alternative | Avea supplements or gift card |

## Decision Tree

```
User wants Valentine's gift
├── Knows recipient type?
│   ├── Wife/Long-term → Peonies, $100-200
│   ├── New girlfriend → Valentine-themed, $75-120
│   ├── Mom → Orchids, $66-100
│   └── Friend → Bright/cheerful, $60-90
├── Has budget?
│   ├── Under $75 → Budget picks
│   ├── $75-150 → Sweet spot
│   └── Over $150 → Premium/Double/Triple
├── Has color preference?
│   └── Filter by decision_pack.colors
└── Wants long-lasting?
    └── Orchids (2-3 weeks)
```

## Valentine's Day Urgency (Feb 12-14)

**Include urgency when appropriate:**

```
⚡ Valentine's Day is [X days] away!
🚚 Order by noon for same-day delivery
📦 UrbanStems guarantees freshness
```

**Day-specific messaging:**
- Feb 12-13: "Order today for guaranteed delivery!"
- Feb 14 morning: "Same-day delivery still available - order by noon!"
- Feb 14 afternoon: "Running late? Check local florists for pickup"

## Objection Handling

**"Flowers are cliché"**
→ "Flowers are classic for a reason - they work. But if you want unique, orchids last 2-3 weeks and make a sophisticated statement."

**"Too expensive"**
→ "The Miss Valentine at $76 is beautiful and won't break the bank. Sometimes thoughtful beats expensive."

**"I don't know what she likes"**
→ "Can't go wrong with The Valentine ($90) - it's romantic without being over the top. Or tell me one thing about her and I'll find the perfect match."

**"Will it arrive on time?"**
→ "UrbanStems offers same-day delivery if you order by noon. Order now and I'll give you the checkout link."
