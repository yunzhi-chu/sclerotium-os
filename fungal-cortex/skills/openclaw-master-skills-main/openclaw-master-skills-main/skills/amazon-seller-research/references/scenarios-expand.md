**Discontinuation Signals**:

⚠️ API provides current snapshot only. Growth rates (`salesGrowthRate`, `bsrGrowthRate`) reflect recent trends but are not historical time-series. Use them as directional indicators, not definitive proof of sustained decline.

| Signal | Data Source | Trigger Condition |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sales decline | `salesGrowthRate` | Negative growth rate (current snapshot) |
| Profit erosion | `profitMargin` | Margin < 10% |
| High competition | `sellerCount` | Currently > 10 sellers |
| BSR worsening | `bsrGrowthRate` | Negative BSR growth (rank number increasing) |
| Weak market | `sampleAvgMonthlySales` | Category avg below viable threshold |

**Note:** `salesGrowthRate` and `bsrGrowthRate` come from `products`/`competitors` interface. `realtime/product` does NOT provide these fields. For stronger evidence, run this analysis periodically and compare snapshots.
