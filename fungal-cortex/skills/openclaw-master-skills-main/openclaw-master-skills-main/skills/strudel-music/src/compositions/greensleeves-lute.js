// Greensleeves — sample-based lute reproduction
// 71 two-bar slices of actual lute performance (other+vocals stems recombined)
// Full polyphonic texture: melody + bass counterline + arpeggiation
// G minor, 3/4 time, ~80 BPM effective
// Dynamic arc preserved in the samples themselves

setcpm(80/4)

// Play all 71 two-bar slices in sequence
// Each slice is 2.23s = exactly one cycle at this tempo
// The real lute, not a synthesis approximation
