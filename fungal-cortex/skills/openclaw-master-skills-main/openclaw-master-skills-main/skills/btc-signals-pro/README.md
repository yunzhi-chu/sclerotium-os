# BTC Signals Pro for OpenClaw

Empower your OpenClaw AI agent with institutional-grade Bitcoin trading intelligence. This skill connects your local agent to over 50+ real-time data sources, providing AI-driven market analysis, derivatives flow, liquidation heatmaps, and macroeconomic calendars entirely through natural conversation.

## 🚀 What Your Agent Can Do Now

Instead of staring at charts and scanning Twitter, just ask your OpenClaw agent:

* **Market Snapshot:** *"What's Bitcoin doing right now? Give me the current trade score and Fear & Greed index."*
* **Contrarian Intel:** *"Are retail traders mostly long or short on Binance right now? Where are the nearest liquidation pools?"*
* **Trade Setups:** *"Give me a short-term scalp trade setup for BTC right now including stop loss, take profit targets, and the AI rationale."*
* **Macro & News:** *"Are there any high-impact economic events on the calendar today? Summarize the latest breaking crypto news."*
* **Deep Technicals:** *"Where is the strongest price confluence acting as a magnet below the current price?"*

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

We know crypto tools require the highest level of trust. 
* **Zero File System Access:** This skill only requests network access to query the secure `api.btcsignals.pro` endpoints. It cannot read, write, or access your local files.
* **Local Execution:** All AI processing of the data happens locally through your OpenClaw instance.
* **Credential Safety:** Your API key is stored securely in your OpenClaw config and is never printed in chat or shared with third parties.
