# Client Communication Engine

This skill handles all outgoing communication from the accounting firm to its clients. It produces professional Greek-language letters, summaries, and notifications — the documents and emails that clients actually receive. Every piece of outgoing communication follows Greek business correspondence conventions, references the correct regulatory terminology, and is drafted for human review before anything is sent.

The skill pairs with `greek-email-processor` (Skill 4), which handles inbound. Together they form the complete communication layer: Skill 4 reads the inbox, Skill 16 writes the outbox.


## Setup

```bash
export OPENCLAW_DATA_DIR="/data"
export SMTP_HOST="smtp.your-provider.com" # e.g. smtp.gmail.com, smtp.outlook.com
export SMTP_USER="accounting@yourfirm.gr"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="app-specific-password"
which jq curl || sudo apt install jq curl
```

SMTP credentials are required for sending client correspondence. All communications are drafted locally and require human review and approval before sending. Use app-specific passwords.


## Core Philosophy

- **Draft First, Send Second**: Nothing is sent automatically. Every communication is drafted, shown for review, and requires explicit approval before dispatch. This applies to all communication types without exception
- **Greek Business Standards**: Output matches what a professional Greek accounting firm would send — correct formal register, appropriate regulatory terminology, proper salutations and closings for Greek business correspondence
- **Data-Driven Content**: Letters are generated from real system data — actual submission reference numbers, actual VAT amounts, actual deadlines. Nothing is fabricated or approximated
- **Logged Against Client Record**: Every sent communication is recorded in `/data/clients/{AFM}/correspondence/` with timestamp, type, recipient, and content hash. The firm always knows what was said to whom and when
- **Context-Aware Tone**: Document request letters are polite but clear. Deadline reminders escalate appropriately (informative → reminder → urgent → critical) without being aggressive. Submission confirmations are formal and precise
- **Language Boundary**: Communications to clients are in Greek. Internal summaries and draft previews shown to firm staff are in English. The skill never sends English to a Greek client

## Approval Workflow

```yaml
Approval_Rules:

  always_required_for:
    - Any communication going to a client
    - Any batch send affecting multiple clients
    - Any custom (free-form) draft

  approval_roles_allowed:
    - senior_accountant   # Can approve all communication types
    - accountant          # Can approve for their assigned clients
    - assistant           # Cannot approve sends — can only create drafts

  approval_gate:
    step_1: "Show draft preview in English (what the letter says)"
    step_2: "Show full Greek text for verification"
    step_3: "Show recipient name and email"
    step_4: "Require: openclaw comms send --draft-id {id} --approved-by {username}"
    step_5: "Verify username has approval role via openclaw auth check-access"
    step_6: "Log approval event to /data/auth/logs/access/"
    step_7: "Send and write sent record"

  no_auto_send_exceptions:
    note: "There are no exceptions. Even batch sends require --approved-by from an authorised user."
```

## Memory Integration (Phase 4 — Skill 19 hooks)

```yaml
Memory_Integration:
  log_episodes: true
  episode_types:
    - communication_drafted      # Draft created
    - communication_sent         # Approved and dispatched
    - batch_send_complete        # Batch run completed

  log_failures: true
  failure_types:
    - missing_recipient_email    # Client has no email address configured
    - data_unavailable_for_draft # Required source data not yet in system
    - approval_denied            # Draft reviewed and rejected by accountant
    - delivery_bounced           # Email send attempted but bounced

  rate_limit_group: "phase_3b_operations"

  useful_patterns_to_detect:
    - "Clients who frequently have document requests (chronic missing documents)"
    - "Communication types that are consistently reviewed and edited before send (template improvement candidates)"
    - "Clients where emails bounce (contact details need updating)"
```

## Error Handling

```yaml
Error_Responses:

  no_email_configured:
    output: "Client {AFM} has no email address on file. Draft created — export as PDF for manual delivery."
    action: "Create draft, set delivery_method to pdf-export, log missing email as client record issue"

  missing_source_data:
    output: "Cannot draft {type} for {AFM} {period} — {specific field} not yet available in system."
    action: "Do not create draft. Log as failure. Add to dashboard task queue once data is ready."

  approval_role_insufficient:
    output: "User {username} does not have approval permission for sends. Draft saved — ask an accountant or senior accountant to approve."
    action: "Block send. Log attempt. Draft remains in /data/processing/comms/."

  bounced_delivery:
    output: "Communication to {email} bounced. Draft {id} logged as delivery-failed."
    action: "Write sent record with status=bounced. Alert assigned accountant. Flag client contact details for review."

  template_data_gap:
    output: "Template field [{field}] could not be populated — data not found."
    action: "Populate with [MISSING — please verify] marker. Show to reviewer before approval. Never send with unfilled markers."
```

## Success Metrics

A successful deployment of this skill should achieve:
- ✅ Zero communications sent without explicit human approval from an authorised role
- ✅ 100% of sent communications logged against the client record
- ✅ Greek output that a client would receive without knowing it was system-generated
- ✅ Tone correctly escalated for deadline reminders based on days remaining
- ✅ Document request letters draw from live pending.json — never manually typed lists
- ✅ Submission confirmations include actual AADE reference numbers — never placeholders
- ✅ Unfilled template markers ([MISSING]) always caught at review, never sent

Remember: This skill is the firm's voice to its clients. Every letter reflects on the firm's professionalism. Draft quality must be high enough that the reviewer's job is approval, not rewriting.
