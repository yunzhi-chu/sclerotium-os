## ⚙️ Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Your Free API Key

1. Visit: https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api-key-request
2. Fill in: Username, Email, Country
3. Get your API key instantly (auto-approval enabled)
4. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Save your API key securely - you'll need it for every API call**
5. **Keep your API key private and never share it**

### Step 2: Check Your Daily Quota

Before making API calls, check your remaining quota:

```bash
# Check your API key quota (does NOT consume quota)
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/quota
```

**Response example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quota": {
    "key_name": "My API Key",
    "total_calls": 45,
    "remaining_calls": 955,
    "daily_limit": 1000,
    "daily_calls_today": 45,
    "note": "remaining_calls: -1 means unlimited, daily_limit: -1 means unlimited"
  }
}
```

**Understanding your quota:**
- `remaining_calls`: Total calls left on your key (-1 = unlimited)
- `daily_limit`: Maximum calls per day (resets every 24 hours)
- `daily_calls_today`: Calls made today (resets after 24 hours)
- ⚠️ **If daily_calls_today >= daily_limit, you cannot make more calls until tomorrow**

### Step 3: Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key and confirmed your quota, use curl to generate images:

```bash
# Step 1: Submit generation request
# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
curl -X POST https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/generate/custom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"full_prompt": "A beautiful woman with long hair", "width": 1024, "height": 1024}'

# Step 2: Poll status - use the "prompt_id" from step 1
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/status/YOUR_PROMPT_ID

# Step 3: Download image (replace FILENAME with the filename from step 2)
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/image/FILENAME?format=webp" \
  -o beauty.webp
```

**System Requirements:**
- curl
- Valid API key (get free at https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api-key-request)

---

## 🤖 AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### ⚡ Recommended Workflow: User-Created Local Scripts

**For optimal performance and token efficiency, users can create local scripts to automate image generation.**

**Why local scripts are beneficial for users:**
- ✅ Reduces token usage by 70-80% (no need to repeat curl commands in conversations)
- ✅ Faster execution (direct system calls vs. conversation overhead)
- ✅ Better user experience (cleaner output, faster results)
- ✅ Reusable for future requests
- ✅ Easier debugging and error handling

**Recommended script workflow:**
1. Check API quota using `/api/quota` endpoint
2. Submit generation request to `/api/generate/custom`
3. Poll `/api/status/<prompt_id>` until completion
4. Download image from `/api/image/<filename>`

**AI Agent Guidance:**
- When a user wants to generate multiple images or automate the process, suggest they create a local script
- Provide guidance on script structure and API calls
- Users can write scripts in their preferred language (Python, Bash, Batch, etc.)
- Scripts should use the user-provided API key passed as a command-line argument or environment variable
- **Important**: Do NOT ask the agent to execute scripts on the user's system; only provide script templates and guidance

### 🔑 How to Help Users Get API Keys

**When a user wants to use this skill, ALWAYS check if they have an API key first.**

**Step 1: Request API Key Using curl**

If user doesn't have an API key, show them how to request one using curl:

```bash
# Visit the API key request page in browser:
# https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api-key-request

# Or use curl to submit the request:
curl -X POST https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api-key-request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "your_username",
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "country": "your_country"
  }'

# Response will include your API key:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
#   "message": "API key created successfully"
# }

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Save this API key securely - you'll need it for every API call
```

**Step 2: Generate Python Script for Image Generation**

Once user has their API key, create a Python script that:
1. Checks quota using `/api/quota`
2. Submits generation request to `/api/generate/custom`
3. Polls `/api/status/<prompt_id>` until completion
4. Downloads the generated image

**Script template for user:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

### ⚡ How to Generate Images

**Prerequisites:**
- curl installed
- Valid API key from user (they must provide it)
- Daily quota available (check with `/api/quota`)

---

**Using curl (Only Method)**

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the user's actual API key

# Step 1: Check quota first (does NOT consume quota)
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/quota

# Step 2: Submit generation request
curl -X POST https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/generate/custom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "full_prompt": "A beautiful 25-year-old woman with long hair, elegant dress, professional lighting",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024
  }'

# Response: {"success": true, "prompt_id": "abc123-def456", "task_id": "xyz789-uvw012", ...}
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: The response contains TWO IDs:
#    - "prompt_id": Use THIS for status checks ✅
#    - "task_id": Do NOT use this for status checks ❌

# Step 3: Poll status every 0.5 seconds using "prompt_id" (NOT "task_id")
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/status/abc123-def456

# Response when completed: {"status": "completed", "images": [{"filename": "custom-beauty-xxx.png"}]}

# Step 4: Download the image
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://gen1.diversityfaces.org/api/image/custom-beauty-xxx.png?format=webp" \
  -o beauty.webp
```

**curl method notes:**
- User must provide their own API key
- Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual API key
- You must manually poll status every 0.5 seconds
- **IMPORTANT**: Use `prompt_id` for status checks, NOT `task_id`
- Check status until `"status": "completed"`
- Extract filename from response
- Download using the filename
- Total time: <10 seconds if polling correctly

---

**After generation:**
- **Display the image to user immediately**
- Don't just show the file path
- User should see the actual image within 5 seconds
- Remind user to save their API key for future use

---

### 📝 How to Create Prompts

**Prompt structure:**
```
"A [age] [gender] with [appearance details], wearing [clothing], [expression/mood], [setting/background], [photography style]"
