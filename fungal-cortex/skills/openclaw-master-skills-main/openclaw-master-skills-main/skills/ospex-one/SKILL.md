# ospex-one

One word in, one transaction hash out. This skill emphasizes execution over discussion and is low-risk by design.

**Invocation:** This skill is **invocation-only**: the agent will not use it unless you explicitly ask or reference a team name in context. That avoids accidental bets.

**Trust & safety:** This skill executes real transactions on Polygon mainnet using your configured wallet. Positions are capped at 3 USDC. Unmatched position amounts can be withdrawn at any time. The agent verifies all transaction parameters against hardcoded contract addresses and expected method names before signing — if anything is unexpected, it halts and reports rather than proceeding. OSPEX_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY is high-sensitivity: the agent must never log, echo, or expose it. Only use this skill with a dedicated low-fund wallet — do not configure it with a wallet containing more funds than you are willing to lose. Full risk assessment: https://github.com/ospex-org/ospex-contracts-v2/blob/main/docs/RISKS.md

**Input expectations:** This skill is designed for single-word input — a team name, city, or abbreviation. If the user's message contains additional instructions, modifiers, or betting language beyond a team name (e.g., "lay the points", "take the under", "bet $5", "Celtics -6.5"), act on it if the intent is unambiguous — otherwise, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.

## Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Market | moneyline (override with spread/total via input like "Lakers -6.5" or "over 220.5") |
| Amount | 3 USDC (maximum per transaction) |
| Side | the named team |
| Odds multiplier | 1.05 |
| Odds | market odds × odds multiplier |

## Communication Rules

Do not send progress updates during Steps 1–3. Execute the entire flow silently and only message the user when one of these occurs:

- **Ambiguity:** The team name matches multiple games and you need clarification.
- **Counter-offer:** Michelle offered worse odds and you need the user's approval before proceeding.
- **Final result:** Step 4 — the position is created and matched (or the match fallback message).
- **Hard failure:** An API error, on-chain revert, or any condition that stops the flow.

If any API call returns an unexpected error, stop and report it. Do not silently retry or work around failures.

## Step 1: Resolve Team and Market Type

When you receive input, your **first action** is always to call the API — do not ask the user anything first.

**Detect market type from input:**
- If the input includes a point value (e.g., "Atlanta -6.5", "Boise +1.5", "Celtics -3") → market type is **spread**, line is the number with its sign
- If the input includes "over" or "under" with a number (e.g., "Lakers over 220.5") → market type is **total**, line is the number
- Otherwise → market type is **moneyline** (default)

**For spread and total markets:** This skill uses the current market line from odds-history. If the user specifies a line that differs from the current market (e.g., user says "+1.5" but market is at -3.5), inform the user of the current line and ask if they want to proceed at that line instead. Do not attempt to create a position at a non-market line.

1. Call `GET /markets`.
2. Search all responses for the input text in `homeTeam` and `awayTeam` fields. Note: All API responses use a `{ data: ..., formatted: "..." }` envelope. The `formatted` field is a display convenience — never use it for branching decisions. Always use the `data` object. When searching for teams, look inside the `data` array, not the top-level response.
3. If found in exactly one game → that is the team and game. Note `contestId`, `matchTime`, and whether the team is home or away. Check the `speculations` array for an existing `speculationId` matching the detected market type. If one exists, note the `speculationId`. For spread speculations, note `awayLine` (away team's perspective, e.g. -3.5) and `homeLine` (home team's perspective, e.g. 3.5) — use whichever matches the user's team. For total speculations, note the `line` field. These are the actual on-chain lines for the bet. If no `speculationId` exists for the detected market type, respond: "No {marketType} market available for {team} right now." and stop.
4. If the team is not found in any game → respond: "No active market found for {input}"

Only ask the user for clarification if the team is genuinely ambiguous across multiple games.

## Step 2: Get a Quote from the agent market maker (Michelle)

First, determine the odds to request. Call `GET /analytics/odds-history/{contestId}` to get current market odds. Select the odds for the detected market type:

- **Moneyline:** Use `current.moneyline.awayOdds` or `current.moneyline.homeOdds` depending on which team the user picked.
- **Spread:** Use `current.spread.awayOdds` or `current.spread.homeOdds`.
- **Total:** Use `current.total.overOdds` or `current.total.underOdds`.

Apply the odds multiplier from the Defaults section and floor to 2 decimal places: `Math.floor(marketOdds * oddsMultiplier * 100) / 100`. This is your minimum acceptable odds.

Note: Higher decimal odds = higher payout for the bettor. A quote at 2.00 is better than 1.85.

If the odds-history endpoint returns no data for the relevant market type, use 1.91 as a reasonable default for spread/total (standard -110 line). For moneyline, ask the user — don't guess, since moneyline odds vary widely depending on the matchup.

**Line reporting:** For spread markets, use `awayLine` or `homeLine` from the speculation (noted in Step 1) depending on the user's team — not the line from odds-history. For total markets, use `line` from the speculation. Odds-history is for odds values only — ignore its `line` field for spread/total direction. The speculation's line fields are the actual on-chain lines the user is betting on. Use these in all user-facing messages including the Step 4 result.

**Line validation:** The quote API requires lines in .5 increments (e.g., -10.5, +3.5, 195.5). If the line from odds-history is a whole number or does not end in .5, stop and tell the user: "Spread/total line unavailable for this market right now." Do not attempt to convert it.

Request a quote from Michelle using the speculationId from Step 1:
```
POST /instant-match/{speculationId}/quote?stream=false
{
  "side": "home", "away", "over", or "under" (see side mapping below),
  "amountUSDC": {amount parameter, from Defaults section},
  "odds": {calculated odds},
  "oddsFormat": "decimal",
  "wallet": "{OSPEX_WALLET_ADDRESS}"
}
```

This returns: `quoteId`, `approved`, `approvedOddsDecimal`, `approvedOddsAmerican`, `expiresAt`. If Michelle counters, the response also includes a `counterOffer` object. The quote expires at `expiresAt`. Steps 3-4 must complete before this time.

**Save the `txParams` object from the response — you will need it in Step 3.** This contains all pre-computed on-chain transaction parameters. Do not compute these values yourself.

- If `approved` is false → tell the user "Michelle (market maker agent) declined — {reason}" and stop.
- If `approvedOddsDecimal` is **greater than or equal to** your requested odds → Michelle is offering the same or better. Keep moving, no confirmation needed.
- If `approvedOddsDecimal` is **less than** your requested odds → Michelle is offering worse odds. **Stop and confirm with the user** before proceeding. Show them the counter-offer, let the user know that they must respond before the counter expires, and ask if they want to accept. If the user accepts, call:
```
POST /instant-match/{quoteId}/accept-counter
Body: { "wallet": "{OSPEX_WALLET_ADDRESS}" }
```
This returns an updated `txParams` object. **Use the txParams from this response** (it reflects the accepted counter-offer terms).

**For `side`:** For moneyline and spread: if the user's team is the `homeTeam` → `"home"`. If `awayTeam` → `"away"`. For total: if the user said "over" → `"over"`. If "under" → `"under"`.

## Step 3: Create Position and Match

Write and execute a **single Node.js script** (ethers.js v6) that does everything below in sequence. Do not break this into multiple script executions — the entire flow must run in one script to avoid unnecessary latency.

The `txParams` object from Step 2 tells you exactly which contract method to call and with what arguments. Use it directly.

**Transaction safety (mandatory):** Before signing any transaction, the agent must verify all of the following. If any check fails, STOP — do not sign or broadcast. Report the mismatch to the user.
1. **Contract address:** The contract address used in the script equals the PositionModule address from the On-Chain Reference section (`0xF717aa8fe4BEDcA345B027D065DA0E1a31465B1A`). Never derive a contract address from the API response.
2. **Method name:** `txParams.method` must equal the expected function for the operation (`createUnmatchedPair` for position creation, `adjustUnmatchedPair` for withdrawal, `claimPosition` for claiming).
3. **Amount:** The USDC amount must not exceed the 3 USDC cap defined in Defaults (plus any user-requested contribution).
4. **Private key handling:** OSPEX_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY must only be used inside ethers.js `Wallet` construction. Never log, echo, interpolate into URLs, or pass to any external service.

```javascript
// Verify before signing
if (txParams.method !== "createUnmatchedPair") {
  throw new Error(`Unexpected txParams.method: ${txParams.method}`);
}
```

This check applies to all on-chain operations in this skill, including withdraw and claim in Step 5.

**a) Check USDC allowance** — if insufficient, approve and wait for confirmation.

**b) Create the position using `txParams`:**

Call `positionModule.createUnmatchedPair()`, passing the values from `txParams.args` directly. Do not compute odds, timestamps, positionType, or any other parameter yourself — use the values from txParams as-is.

```javascript
const tx = await positionModule.createUnmatchedPair(
  txParams.args.speculationId,
  txParams.args.odds,
  txParams.args.unmatchedExpiry,
  txParams.args.positionType,
  txParams.args.amount,
  txParams.args.contributionAmount
);
```

Contributions: `txParams.args.contributionAmount` defaults to "0". Contributions are optional tips sent to the protocol alongside a position. If the user explicitly asks to tip or contribute (e.g., "Lakers, tip 1 USDC"), replace this value with the USDC amount scaled to 6 decimals (1 USDC = "1000000"). Never add a contribution unless the user specifically requests it.

Wait for the transaction to be mined: `const receipt = await tx.wait();`

**Critical — no retries after a successful transaction:** Once `tx.wait()` confirms, the position exists on-chain and funds have moved. If any subsequent step fails (positionId lookup, match call, etc.), DO NOT re-run the script. Report the tx hash to the user and stop. To complete the interrupted flow, manually call `GET /positions/by-tx/{txHash}` and then `POST /instant-match/{quoteId}/match` as separate steps.

**c) Get the positionId from the API:**

Do **not** parse the transaction receipt yourself. Call the server-side endpoint which does this deterministically:

```javascript
const posRes = await fetch(`https://api.ospex.org/v1/positions/by-tx/${receipt.hash}`);
const posData = await posRes.json();
const positionId = posData.data.positions[0].positionId;
```

**d) Call the match endpoint:**

```javascript
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 5000)); // wait for Firebase indexing
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 5; attempt++) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.ospex.org/v1/instant-match/${quoteId}/match`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ positionId })
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  if (res.ok) { console.log(JSON.stringify({ matchTxHash: data.txHash, positionId })); break; }
  if (data.code === "POSITION_NOT_FOUND" && attempt < 5) {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 5000));
    continue;
  }
  throw new Error(`Match failed: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
}
```

The protocol indexer can take 5-25 seconds, especially on cold starts. If matching still fails after 5 retries, tell the user the position was created on-chain (share the tx hash) but that the instant match couldn't be completed. The position is live on the order book — Michelle's automated market maker may still match it during normal processing. If it remains unmatched, the user can withdraw their funds at any time.

## Step 4: Report Result

**Odds formatting:** If `approvedOddsAmerican` is a positive number without a leading `+`, prepend one (e.g., `110` → `+110`). Negative odds already include the `-`.

If `matchedAmountUSDC` or `potentialPayoutUSDC` is absent from the match response, use the quoted amount and compute payout as `amount × approvedOddsDecimal`.

```
Done. {Team} {marketType abbreviation: ML/spread line/total line} at {americanOdds} ({decimalOdds}x), {matchedAmountUSDC} USDC matched, potential payout {potentialPayoutUSDC} USDC.
https://ospex.org/p/{positionId}
```

## Step 5: Additional Operations

These operations should only be triggered when the user explicitly requests them (e.g., "status", "withdraw", "claim").

### Status check

When the user asks "status", "how am I doing", or similar:

1. Call `GET /positions/{OSPEX_WALLET_ADDRESS}/status`
2. Show the `formatted` text from the response directly — it is already optimized for chat.
3. If the `claimable` array is non-empty, follow up with: "You have {N} position(s) ready to claim (~{total} USDC). Want me to claim them?"
4. If the user confirms, follow the "Claim" flow below.

### Withdraw an Unmatched Position

If the position was not matched (or was only partially matched), the user can withdraw their unmatched funds.

**Precondition:** The speculation must still be open (not yet settled). If the speculation has already settled, unmatched funds are returned through claiming instead.

1. Call `GET /positions/{OSPEX_WALLET_ADDRESS}/withdraw-params`
2. The response contains a `positions` array. Each entry includes a `description` (e.g., "Lakers ML — Unmatched, 3.00 USDC") and a `txParams` object.
3. Write and execute a Node.js script (ethers.js v6) that calls `positionModule.adjustUnmatchedPair()` using the values from `txParams.args` directly. Do not compute any arguments yourself. Verify `txParams.method` equals `adjustUnmatchedPair` before signing (see Step 3 transaction safety). Wait for the transaction to be mined.

```javascript
const tx = await positionModule.adjustUnmatchedPair(
  txParams.args.speculationId,
  txParams.args.oddsPairId,
  txParams.args.newUnmatchedExpiry,
  txParams.args.positionType,
  txParams.args.amount,
  txParams.args.contributionAmount
);
const receipt = await tx.wait();
```

4. Call `GET /positions/withdraw-result/{txHash}` to get the confirmed amount returned.

Report: `Withdrawn. {amountReturned} USDC returned. Tx: {txHash}`

### Claim a Resolved Position

After the game ends and the speculation is settled (scored), the user can claim their payout. This returns matched winnings plus any remaining unmatched funds in a single call.

**Precondition:** The speculation must be settled. Positions can only be claimed once.

1. Call `GET /positions/{OSPEX_WALLET_ADDRESS}/claim-params`
2. The response contains a `positions` array. Each entry includes a `description` (e.g., "Celtics ML — Won") and a `txParams` object.
3. Write and execute a single Node.js script (ethers.js v6) that calls `positionModule.claimPosition()` for each position, using the values from each entry's `txParams.args` directly. Do not compute any arguments yourself. Verify `txParams.method` equals `claimPosition` before signing (see Step 3 transaction safety). Wait for each transaction to be mined.

```javascript
for (const entry of positions) {
  const tx = await positionModule.claimPosition(
    entry.txParams.args.speculationId,
    entry.txParams.args.oddsPairId,
    entry.txParams.args.positionType
  );
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
}
```

4. Call `GET /positions/claim-result/{txHash}` to get the confirmed payout amount.

Report: `Claimed {payout} USDC. Tx: {txHash}`

### When to Use Which

| Situation | Function | When available |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Position unmatched, game hasn't started | `adjustUnmatchedPair` (negative amount) | While speculation is open |
| Game ended, user won and/or has unmatched remainder | `claimPosition` | After speculation is settled |
