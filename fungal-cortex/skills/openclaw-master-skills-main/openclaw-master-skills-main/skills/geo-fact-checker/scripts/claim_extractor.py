"""
Claim extraction helper for the geo-fact-checker skill.

This module provides simple utilities to extract and represent factual claims
from a block of text. It is intentionally lightweight so it can be adapted
or extended by higher-level agents as needed.

The skill using this script is responsible for deciding which claims to
prioritize for verification, how to search for evidence, and how to apply
corrections in the user's content.
