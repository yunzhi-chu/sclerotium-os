# Kevros

Cryptographic governance for autonomous agents: precision decisioning, provenance attestation, intent binding, capability delegation, policy analysis, and compliance export.

Every decision gets a signed release token. Every action gets a hash-chained record. Every intent gets a cryptographic binding to its command. Downstream services verify independently — no callbacks, no trust assumptions.

**Base URL:** `https://governance.taskhawktech.com`

## Data Handling

This plugin sends data to the Kevros governance gateway. Understand what is transmitted before installing.

**Before tool execution** (`before_tool_call` hook):
- Tool name and full input payload are sent to `POST /governance/verify` for policy evaluation.
- The gateway hashes raw payloads (SHA-256) on receipt. Only digests are stored in the provenance chain.

**After tool execution** (`after_tool_call` hook):
- Tool name, a **truncated output summary (up to 500 characters)**, and governance metadata (release token, epoch, verification ID) are sent to `POST /governance/attest`.
- If tool output contains sensitive data, the 500-char summary may include it. Review your tool outputs before enabling attestation, or disable post-execution attestation by setting `autoAttest: false` in config.

**Network behavior:**
- All transmissions use HTTPS to `https://governance.taskhawktech.com`.
- If `KEVROS_API_KEY` is not set, the plugin calls `POST /signup` to auto-provision a free-tier key on first use (1,000 calls/month). Set the key explicitly to avoid implicit network signup.
- In `enforce` mode (default), unreachable gateway blocks high-risk tool calls. Use `advisory` mode for evaluation — it logs decisions without blocking.

## Quick Start

Get an API key (free, instant, no payment):

```bash
curl -X POST https://governance.taskhawktech.com/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "your-agent-id"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "api_key": "kvrs_...",
  "tier": "free",
  "monthly_limit": 1000,
  "usage": {
    "header": "X-API-Key"
  }
}
```

Use the API key in all subsequent requests via the `X-API-Key` header.

## Precision Decisioning

**POST /governance/verify**

Verify an action against policy bounds before execution. Returns ALLOW, CLAMP, or DENY with a cryptographic release token that any downstream service can verify independently.

Request:

```json
{
  "action_type": "api_call",
  "action_payload": {
    "endpoint": "/deploy",
    "service": "api-v2",
    "replicas": 3
  },
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "policy_context": {
    "max_values": { "replicas": 5 },
    "forbidden_keys": ["sudo", "force"]
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "decision": "ALLOW",
  "verification_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "release_token": "f7a8b9c0...",
  "applied_action": {
    "endpoint": "/deploy",
    "service": "api-v2",
    "replicas": 3
  },
  "reason": "All values within policy bounds",
  "epoch": 42,
  "provenance_hash": "e3b0c442...",
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-02-26T12:00:00Z"
}
```

- **ALLOW** — proceed as planned. The `release_token` is proof.
- **CLAMP** — action was adjusted to safe bounds. Use `applied_action` instead of your original.
- **DENY** — action rejected. Do not proceed. `release_token` is null.

Share the `release_token` with collaborating agents so they can independently verify the decision.

## Provenance Attestation

**POST /governance/attest**

Record a completed action in a hash-chained, append-only evidence ledger. Each attestation extends your provenance chain. Your raw payload is SHA-256 hashed — actual data is never stored.

Request:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "action_description": "Deployed api-v2 with 3 replicas",
  "action_payload": {
    "service": "api-v2",
    "replicas": 3,
    "status": "success"
  },
  "context": {
    "environment": "production",
    "triggered_by": "scheduled"
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "attestation_id": "b2c3d4e5-...",
  "epoch": 43,
  "hash_prev": "e3b0c442...",
  "hash_curr": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-02-26T12:00:01Z",
  "chain_length": 43
}
```

A longer chain with consistent outcomes builds a higher trust score over time.

## Intent Binding

**POST /governance/bind**

Bind a declared intent to a specific command. Creates a cryptographic link between what you plan to do and the command that does it. Prove later that you did exactly what you said you would.

Request:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "intent_type": "MAINTENANCE",
  "intent_description": "Scale api-v2 to handle traffic spike",
  "command_payload": {
    "action": "scale",
    "service": "api-v2",
    "replicas": 5
  },
  "goal_state": {
    "replicas": 5,
    "healthy": true
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "intent_id": "c3d4e5f6-...",
  "intent_hash": "d4e5f6a7...",
  "binding_id": "e5f6a7b8-...",
  "binding_hmac": "a7b8c9d0...",
  "command_hash": "b8c9d0e1...",
  "epoch": 44,
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-02-26T12:00:02Z"
}
```

Save `intent_id` and `binding_id` to verify outcomes later.

## Verify Outcome

  "intent_id": "c3d4e5f6-...",
  "status": "ACHIEVED",
  "achieved_percentage": 100.0,
  "discrepancy": null,
  "evidence_hash": "c9d0e1f2...",

Request:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "operations": [
    {
      "type": "verify",
      "params": {
        "action_type": "api_call",
        "action_payload": {"endpoint": "/deploy", "replicas": 3}
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "attest",
      "params": {
        "action_description": "Deployment completed",
        "action_payload": {"status": "success"}
      }
    }
  ],
  "stop_on_deny": false
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "g7h8i9j0-...",
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "total": 2,
  "executed": 2,
  "results": [
    {"index": 0, "type": "verify", "status": "ok", "result": {"decision": "ALLOW", "...": "..."}},

## Capability Delegation

**POST /governance/delegate**

Grant scoped, time-limited capabilities to another agent. The delegation is HMAC-signed and recorded in the provenance chain. Supports hierarchical sub-delegation with restrictive scope intersection.

Request:

```json
{
  "delegator_agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "delegatee_agent_id": "helper-agent-42",
  "scope": {
    "allowed_endpoints": ["verify", "attest"],
    "policy_overrides": {"max_values": {"replicas": 3}},
    "max_calls": 100
  },
  "ttl_seconds": 3600,
  "description": "Handle deployment verification",
  "allow_subdelegation": false
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "delegation_id": "h8i9j0k1-...",

  "include_children": true
}
```

Returns reversibility status, constraints, time elapsed, and child dependency analysis.

## Policy Replay

**POST /governance/replay**

Replay provenance records through an alternative policy. Deterministic "what-if" analysis: "What would have happened if we'd used policy X instead?"

Request:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
  "template_id": "strict_safety",
  "limit": 50
}
```

Response:

```json

  "replay_policy": {"max_values": {"speed": 3.0}},
  "changes": {"upgraded": 5, "downgraded": 12, "unchanged": 33},
  "results": [
    {
      "epoch": 42,
      "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
      "action_type": "motor_command",
      "original_decision": "ALLOW",
      "replayed_decision": "CLAMP",
      "change": "more_restrictive"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use for policy regression testing before deploying new policies, or forensic investigation.

## Counterfactual Analysis

**POST /governance/counterfactual**

Simulate an action against multiple policies simultaneously. Returns a decision matrix showing how each policy handles the same action.

Request:

```json
{
  "action_payload": {"endpoint": "/deploy", "replicas": 10},
  "action_type": "api_call",
  "policies": [
    {"label": "conservative", "template_id": "strict_safety"},
    {"label": "permissive", "policy_context": {"max_values": {"replicas": 20}}},
    {"label": "deny-all", "policy_context": {"forbidden_keys": ["replicas"]}}
  ],
  "include_historical": true,

## Agent Discovery

**GET /.well-known/agent.json**

Returns the A2A protocol agent card. No authentication required.

```

Returns capabilities, supported skills, SDK references, and free-tier signup details.

## MCP

For MCP-native agents, connect directly via streamable-http transport:

```
https://governance.taskhawktech.com/mcp/
```

360 tools, 2 resources, 2 prompts. Auto-provisions a free-tier key on first tool call if no API key is provided.

## Python SDK

```bash
pip install kevros
# or
uv pip install kevros
```

```python
from kevros_governance import GovernanceClient

client = GovernanceClient(agent_id="your-agent-id")
result = client.verify(
    action_type="api_call",
    action_payload={"endpoint": "/deploy"},
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
)
print(result.decision)  # ALLOW, CLAMP, or DENY
```

## Enforcement Modes

Every operator key has an enforcement mode that controls how decisions are applied:

- **enforce** (default) — fail-closed. DENY means DENY. Release tokens are only issued for ALLOW/CLAMP.
- **advisory** — shadow mode. DENY decisions are logged but overridden to ALLOW. No release token is issued for would-be denials. Use for testing policies before enforcing them.
- **gated** — human-in-the-loop. DENY decisions are held for operator approval. Poll `/governance/gated/{request_id}` for status.
- **deny** — kill-switch. ALL requests are blocked regardless of policy evaluation. Use for emergency shutdown.

The `enforcement_mode` field is returned in every verify response. Use `/enforcement` to check your current mode.

Enforcement mode changes require admin-level access and are not available through the plugin. Contact your administrator or use the admin API directly.

## Decision Approach

When collaborating with another agent:

1. **Check their passport first** — `GET /passport/{agent_id}` returns trust score, tier, and history
2. **Embed badges** — Use `GET /passport/{agent_id}/badge.svg` in your agent's description to show your trust level
3. **Trust thresholds:**
   - **Gold tier (score >= 90%)** — proceed with normal collaboration
   - **Silver tier (score 50-89%)** — verify their actions before relying on results
   - **Bronze tier (score < 50%)** — require bound intents with outcome verification
   - **No history** — start with small, low-risk interactions and build trust incrementally
4. **Verify before you rely** — Use `/governance/verify-token` to independently confirm any release token a peer shares with you
