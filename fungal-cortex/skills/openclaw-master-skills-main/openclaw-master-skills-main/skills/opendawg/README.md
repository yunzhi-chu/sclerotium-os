# Bot Arcade — The Universal Entertainment Engine

**Turn any AI bot into a full-blown arcade. Zero APIs. Zero cost. Pure engagement.**

Bot Arcade is an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skill that
transforms any AI agent into a game show host, fortune teller, casino dealer,
dungeon master, and party emcee — all at once.

Out of 13,700+ skills on ClawHub, there is no universal entertainment engine.
Every bot fights the same war: **engagement and retention**. Bot Arcade is the
missing weapon.

| Emoji Slots | Luck | Solo | Instant |
| Trivia Blitz | Knowledge | Solo/Group | 30s/question |
| Word Wars | Language | Solo/PvP | Varies |

## Why Every Bot Needs This

- **Engagement** — Games keep users coming back daily
- **Retention** — Streaks, leaderboards, and achievements create stickiness
- **Virality** — "Beat my score" and shareable wins drive organic growth
- **Monetization** — 7 built-in revenue streams (see monetization playbook)
- **Zero cost** — Pure text/logic, runs locally, no external APIs
- **Universal** — Works on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and 50+ platforms

## Installation

### From ClawHub
```
clawhub install bot-arcade
```

### Manual Install
```bash
# Clone to your OpenClaw workspace
git clone https://github.com/jcools1977/Opendawg.git \
  ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/bot-arcade

# Make the engine executable
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/bot-arcade/scripts/arcade_engine.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+ (for persistent state management)
- No other dependencies — the engine uses only Python stdlib

## Quick Start

Once installed, just chat with your bot:

- **"Let's play a game"** — Opens the arcade menu
- **"/spin"** — Spin the emoji slots
- **"/trivia science"** — Start a science trivia round
- **"/fortune"** — Get your daily fortune
- **"/profile"** — See your stats and achievements
- **"/leaderboard"** — Check the rankings
