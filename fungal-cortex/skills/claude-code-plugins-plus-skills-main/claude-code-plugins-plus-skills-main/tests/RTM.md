# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

> **Status:** policy-zone (engineer-owned). Each row maps a documented
> requirement to its source-of-truth and the test or check that exercises
> it. **No fabricated rows.** Every requirement here is extracted from a
> file already living in this repo — `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
> `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `marketplace/src/content/docs/**`, or one of
> the workflow YAMLs. Do not invent acceptance criteria the repo has never
> committed to.
>
> **Cross-references.** Personas in [`PERSONAS.md`](./PERSONAS.md), flows
> in [`JOURNEYS.md`](./JOURNEYS.md). ADRs in
> `000-docs/000-DR-ADR-*.md` (notably ADR #619 declining Stryker /
> dep-cruiser / Semgrep / BDD).

## Out of scope (declined ADRs)

| ID | Decision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| WONT-001 | Stryker mutation testing — declined | ADR #619 |
| WONT-002 | dependency-cruiser — declined | ADR #619 |
| WONT-003 | Semgrep static analysis — declined | ADR #619 |
| WONT-004 | BDD / Gherkin scenarios — declined | ADR #619 |

## Notes

- **MoSCoW interpretation:** MUST = repo will not ship without it; SHOULD =
  signal of quality, blocks at marketplace tier; COULD = nice-to-have;
  WON'T = explicitly declined (see WONT- rows).
- **Status interpretation:** "covered" means CI fails on regression.
  "partial" means CI surfaces but does not block (informational warning).
  "uncovered" means no automated check exists today — file an issue if you
  want it gated.
- This RTM does not duplicate ADR rationale. ADRs live under
  `000-docs/000-DR-ADR-*.md` and are linked here by ID only.
