# Personas — Tons of Skills / claude-code-plugins-plus-skills

> **Status:** policy-zone (engineer-owned). Update when a real new persona shows

> **Sourcing:** every persona below is drawn from existing repo material
> (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `marketplace/src/content/docs/`, the
> `ccpi` CLI commands, the SaaS pack folder structure, and the MCP plugin
> shape) plus signals from issues / PRs in this repo's history. None are

This document codifies the five user types this codebase actually serves. It
exists to keep tests, docs, and product decisions grounded in the real
surface area we ship — not in a generic "developer persona" abstraction.

---

## Persona 1 — Plugin Author ("Pat")

**Role.** External contributor opening a fork-and-PR to add or update a
plugin or skill. Could be a one-time submitter or a recurring contributor.
Maps to the workflow described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Primary goals.**

- Get a plugin or skill merged into `main` with the contribution credited in
  the README contributor block.
- Pass `./scripts/quick-test.sh` locally before pushing so CI doesn't churn.
- Score above the Intent Solutions 100-point rubric threshold in the
  marketplace-tier validator (`scripts/validate-skills-schema.py
  --marketplace`).
- Get actionable feedback fast — Gemini PR review within 2–5 minutes,
  maintainer follow-up within 48 hours.
- Have the install command published in the README and `/plugins/<slug>/`
  page work the moment the merge lands.

**Key flows (these become JOURNEYS entries).**

1. Fork → clone → copy from `templates/` → edit plugin → run
   `quick-test.sh` → push → open PR.
2. Address Gemini PR review comments — every `[Critical]` and `[High]`
   finding must be resolved before merge.
3. Land merge → `pnpm run sync-marketplace` runs in CI → catalog updates →
   marketplace site rebuilds → contributor block at top of README gets
   their attribution.
4. Bump version in own plugin's `package.json` → `publish-changed-packages`
   workflow detects the version bump → publishes `@intentsolutionsio/<plugin>`
   to npm.

**What they care about most.**

- The validator's error messages must point at the exact problem (line +
  rule + suggested fix).
- The 100-point rubric is published and stable — they shouldn't get
  surprised by a moving bar.
- Their install command works on day one (no broken `/plugin install`
  string in the merged README).

**What would make them disengage.**

- Validator says "fail" without saying why.
- Quick-test passes locally but CI fails because of a check that's not in
  quick-test.
- The Gemini reviewer is wrong and the maintainer takes a week to weigh in.
- Their plugin lands and the marketplace page 404s for a day.

## Persona 2 — Marketplace Consumer ("Maya")

**Role.** End user browsing [tonsofskills.com](https://tonsofskills.com) to
find plugins or skills. Most arrive via search engines, social posts, or
the install command in someone's blog.

**Primary goals.**

- Find a plugin or skill that solves a specific problem.
- Skim what it does before installing — read description, see verification
  badge, see the install command.
- Copy-paste the `/plugin install` command into Claude Code and have it
  work first try.
- Filter the catalog by category, type, or pack without the page reloading
  or losing scroll position.

**Key flows.**

1. Land on `/` (homepage) → enter a query in the hero search → redirect to
   `/explore?q=<query>` → click a card → land on `/plugins/<slug>/`.
2. Land on `/explore/` directly → use the type-toggle (plugin / skill / all)
   → click a result → land on plugin or skill detail page.
3. Land on `/skills/` → use category + tool filters → click a skill → land
   on `/skills/<slug>/`.
4. Visit `/cowork/` → download the mega-zip or a category bundle → unzip and
   install offline.
5. Read `/docs/getting-started/installation` → install `ccpi` globally →
   add the marketplace → install first plugin.

**What they care about most.**

- Search relevance — typing "git commit" should surface `git-commit-smart`
  near the top.
- The plugin detail page must show what the plugin actually does (not just
  its name + description blurb).
- Install commands are copy-paste correct — no broken slugs, no missing
  catalog suffix.
- Page loads fast on mobile (iPhone 13 / Pixel 5 are the canonical mobile
  viewports — see `marketplace/playwright.config.ts`).

**What would make them disengage.**

- A plugin detail page returns 404.
- The install command in the page copies a different slug than the URL.
- Mobile rendering is broken (lines longer than 5000 chars used to crash
  iOS Safari — `compressHTML: false` in `astro.config.mjs` is there to
  prevent regression).
- Search returns nothing for an obvious query.

## Persona 3 — MCP Integrator ("Mei")

**Role.** Developer wiring an MCP server plugin (`pr-to-spec`,
`domain-memory-agent`, etc.) into their own Claude Code config. These plugins
ship as published npm packages with a TypeScript runtime, not just markdown
instructions.

**Primary goals.**

- Find the right MCP plugin via the marketplace.
- Install the npm package and have its `dist/index.js` be executable + have
  the correct shebang.
- Have the `.mcp.json` in the plugin describe the server contract clearly
  enough that Claude Code's `/mcp` tooling registers it on first try.
- Pin a known-good version (versioning is manual per
  `CLAUDE.md` — `package.json` `version` is the source of truth).

**Key flows.**

1. Browse `/explore?type=plugin&category=mcp` → click an MCP plugin → see
   the install command + `.mcp.json` in the README.
2. `npm install -g @intentsolutionsio/<mcp-plugin>` → the binary is on
   `$PATH` and `--help` works.
3. Wire the MCP server into Claude Code's settings → restart →
   `/mcp` lists the new tools.
4. Bump pinned version when a new release ships (publish-changed-packages
   workflow makes this safe — only versions not yet on npm get published).

**What they care about most.**

- The published `.tgz` actually contains a working `dist/index.js` with
  `chmod +x` — the `cli-smoke-tests` CI job's "Verify bin entrypoint is
  executable" check catches this on every PR.
- Tool names in the MCP server match the documentation — Claude won't
  invoke a tool that doesn't exist.
- No `workspace:` deps in the published `package.json` — verified by the
  `cli-smoke-tests` job's "Verify no workspace dependencies" step.
- `npm pack --dry-run` shows the right files (no `node_modules`, no test
  files, no `.env`).

**What would make them disengage.**

- Published binary is a TypeScript file, not a compiled JS file.
- Shebang missing — Linux refuses to exec the binary.
- Documented MCP tool name doesn't match what the server registers.
- `.mcp.json` references env vars that aren't documented.

## Persona 4 — CLI User ("Casey")

**Role.** Developer using `ccpi` (`@intentsolutionsio/ccpi`) from their
terminal — usually right after running `npm install -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi`
the first time, then again when adding plugins to a new project. Could be
the same human as Maya at a different point in their journey, but the
needs are different so we treat them as a separate persona.

**Primary goals.**

- `ccpi --version` and `ccpi --help` work and exit 0.
- `ccpi marketplace-add` writes the catalog config files.
- `ccpi install <plugin>` prints the right `/plugin install ...` command.
- `ccpi doctor` flags real problems (missing Claude Code config dir,
  outdated catalog, broken installed plugins).
- `ccpi validate --strict` returns non-zero exit code on failure so it
  composes into shell pipelines.

**Key flows.**

1. `npm install -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi` → `ccpi --version` → install
   succeeded.
2. `ccpi marketplace-add` → catalog written → `ccpi list --all` shows
   ~420 plugins.
3. `ccpi install <plugin>` → see the `/plugin install` command → paste
   into Claude Code.
4. `ccpi upgrade --check` → see outdated plugins → `ccpi upgrade --all`
   to refresh.
5. `ccpi doctor` to debug a broken setup.

**What they care about most.**

- Exit codes are meaningful — `0` on success, non-zero on failure. Shell
  pipelines depend on this.
- `--help` text covers every command and flag.
- Bundle size is small (< 50 KB gzipped today) — install latency matters.
  Enforced by the size-limit budget on every PR.
- Semver — major bumps mean breaking command interface, minor means
  additive, patch means bug fix. The cli-publish workflow ties npm
  versions to git tags `cli-v*.*.*`.

**What would make them disengage.**

- A flag silently changes behavior between versions.
- `ccpi doctor` says "all good" but the install actually doesn't work.
- Install pulls in 100 MB of transitive deps.

## Persona 5 — Pack Subscriber ("Sam")

**Role.** Engineer using one of the SaaS skill packs (`langchain-py-pack`,
`clay-pack`, `apollo-pack`, etc.) at `plugins/saas-packs/<vendor>-pack/`.
They want a deeply curated set of skills for one vendor, not a single
plugin. Maps to `marketplace/src/content/docs/guides/saas-skill-packs.md`.

**Primary goals.**

- Install the entire pack with one command (`ccpi install --pack <name>`)
  and get every skill activated.
- Each skill in the pack hits the langchain bar — full SKILL.md frontmatter,
  real code examples, accurate `compatibility:` (matches the actual SaaS
  product version).
- External links (vendor docs, API references) work — broken vendor URLs
  are a high-trust failure.
- Pack version pins to a specific vendor SDK version so the skills don't
  fall out of sync with the API.

**Key flows.**

1. Browse `/explore?type=pack` → click a SaaS pack → read the README.
2. `ccpi install --pack <name>` → install command for every plugin in
   the pack prints out → paste each into Claude Code.
3. Use a skill from the pack inside Claude Code → trigger phrases match
   the SKILL.md frontmatter → skill activates.
4. Vendor releases a new SDK version → pack maintainer bumps each skill's
   `compatibility:` → marketplace tier validator passes → publish flow
   ships a new pack version.

**What they care about most.**

- Skill quality. A pack with 30 stub skills is worse than 5 deep ones.
  The marketplace validator's `is_stub` flag (in
  `freshie/inventory.sqlite`) catches the worst offenders.
- Accurate `compatibility:` field — free-text per `agentskills.io/specification`
  (max 500 chars). Migrated from the deprecated `compatible-with:` CSV
  format via `scripts/batch-remediate.py --migrate-compatible-with`.
- No broken vendor URLs in the skill body or references.
- `validate-internal-links.mjs` catches internal link rot at build time;
  external link drift is currently uncovered (see RTM REQ-016).

**What would make them disengage.**

- Pack lists 30 skills, 25 are stubs.
- A SKILL.md `compatibility:` says "Stripe SDK 2024.x" but the skill body
  references endpoints that were removed in 2025.
- Vendor docs link is dead.

## When to add a sixth persona

Only add a persona when there's repo-visible evidence of a distinct user
type whose needs aren't covered by these five. Specifically:

- A new `ccpi` subcommand whose primary user isn't Casey (e.g. a
  `ccpi telemetry` command would imply an "operations / observability"
  persona).
- A new directory under `plugins/` or `marketplace/src/pages/` that has
  fundamentally different review/install/use flows.
- An issue cluster where five+ inbound reports describe a workflow none
  of the five existing personas would do.

If you can't point at a specific repo signal, the persona is hypothetical
— file it in JOURNEYS as `(uncovered)` instead.
