## [Unreleased]

## [4.33.0] - 2026-05-25

Cowork pipeline correctness pass — the `/cowork/` page is now a
deterministic function of the catalog from disk through deploy, with
a CI gate that fails the build if anyone regresses the contract. Plus
the agency-os plugin lands, a new Unicode hygiene CI gate hardens
contributor PRs against [Trojan Source](https://trojansource.codes/)
attacks (CVE-2021-42574), and the `/cowork/` page itself gets the
prereq banner + setup-guide rewrite that users have been missing.

### Added

- **agency-os plugin** (productivity) — AI agency + Notion board
  orchestrator. Adds the first `productivity/agency-os/` entry to the
  catalog ([#709](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/709)).
- **Unicode hygiene CI gate** (`scripts/validate-unicode-hygiene.py` +
  `.github/workflows/validate-unicode-hygiene.yml`) — blocking gate
  that rejects bidi-override + tag-character abuse in `SKILL.md`,
  `plugin.json`, agent, and command files. Defends against
  [Trojan Source](https://trojansource.codes/) (CVE-2021-42574) and
  the [trapdoor / tag-character class](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#bidirectional_controls)
  of homoglyph attacks. `--strict` mode also blocks zero-width and
  format characters outside the BOM position. Full regression suite
  at `tests/test_validate_unicode_hygiene.py`
  ([#777](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/777)).
- **Idempotent cowork build pipeline + drift gate** — three changes
  that make the cowork download backend self-healing
  ([#780](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/780)):
  - `scripts/build-cowork-zips.mjs` now wipes
    `marketplace/public/downloads/{plugins,bundles}` before each run.
    Output state is exactly what `marketplace.extended.json` declares
    — no more, no less. Removes accumulated orphans in local dev
    (six found this session: `general-legal-assistant`, `langchain-pack`,
    `windsurf` + `automation`, `code-quality`, `finance` bundles).
  - `scripts/validate-cowork-manifest.mjs` (new) — drift gate. Seven
    checks for catalog ↔ manifest ↔ disk alignment, including the
    orphan-zip direction that the existing `validate-cowork-downloads.mjs`
    doesn't cover. Wired into `marketplace/scripts/build.mjs`
    (`cowork:validate` after `cowork:zips`) AND
    `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml` as the named
    `Validate Cowork Manifest Drift` step.
  - `CLAUDE.md` § "Auto-cowork contract" — documents the author
    flow (catalog edit + `pnpm run sync-marketplace` is the entire
    authoring step), pipeline determinism, deploy propagation via
    `rsync --delete`, and the deliberate decision NOT to wire
    `cowork:zips` into `sync-marketplace` (cadence mismatch).

### Fixed

- **`/cowork/` page content gap** — adds an amber prereq banner above
  the hero surfacing install prerequisites, rewrites the setup guide
  for clearer step ordering, and adds an official-resources block
  linking to upstream Anthropic Cowork docs so users aren't routed
  only through this marketplace
  ([#781](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/781)).
- **`.gitleaks.toml` allowlist drift** — extends the existing
  `marketplace/src/data/*.json` allowlist scope to
  `marketplace/public/data/*.json` (the runtime mirror produced by
  `marketplace/scripts/build.mjs`). Both copies bundle SKILL.md body
  HTML (which is allowlisted directly); the bundled mirror must
  follow suit or every catalog regen turns CI red on benign
  documentation examples (e.g., Supabase local-dev demo JWTs with
  `iss: supabase-demo`)
  ([#781](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/781) co-fix).

### Changed

- **CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md, AAR docs, blog posts** — repo-side records
  of the 2026-05-22 → 2026-05-24 CI hardening campaign filed as
  `000-docs/270-AT-AACR-2026-05-22-to-24-ci-hardening-9pr-arc.md`
  ([#775](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/pull/775)).
  Two tonsofskills.com blog posts published documenting the
  self-expiring report-only CI gate pattern and the Unicode hygiene
  gate as same-day trapdoor defense.

## [4.32.0] - 2026-05-24

Single-session CI hardening campaign — 9 sequential PRs took main from
2 required gates to 10, with the underlying violations fixed in-PR
(no report-only crutch left in the pipeline). External contributor
PRs now hit a real bar before merging. Plus ~970 MB of dead
scaffolding removed from the repo root.

### Added

- **10 blocking required CI gates on `main`** (was 2: `validate` +
  `marketplace-validation`). New gates: `eslint-check`, `format-check`
  (prettier), `ruff-check`, `ruff-format-check`, `shellcheck-skills`,
  `typescript-coverage-audit`, `skill-codeblock-syntax`, `markdownlint`.
  Cleanup-arc PRs #764 → #772.
- **`ruff.toml` at repo root** — single source of truth for Python lint
  policy. Selects E4/E7/E9/F curated default; ignores E402 (legit
  sys.path manipulation in plugin entry points) and E741 (short loop
  counters in generator scripts) (#765).
- **`.shellcheckrc` at repo root** — disables SC1090/SC1091 (dynamic
  source paths in plugin entry points), SC2155 (declare-and-assign
  stylistic), SC2034 (unused-var analysis too imprecise across sourced
  files) (#768).
- **`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` at repo root** — single source of truth
  for markdown lint policy across 10,468 markdown files (#767 + #772).
- **`tests/lib/.gitignore` allowlist for AA-AACR session reviews**
  (already merged in #760, retained).

### Changed

- **730 ruff errors → 0** across plugins/, scripts/, freshie/. 562
  auto-fixes + 33 unsafe-fixes + 33 typing imports added to mass-
  generated scripts + 1 real bug fix (`webhook_handler_template.py`
  needed `nonlocal delay` in a retry-decorator closure) + 374 files
  reformatted via `ruff format` (#765).
- **244 ruff errors → 0** on PR E's 47 renamed `.sh` → `.py` files
  (mis-extensioned Python scripts that had never been ruff-checked)
  (#770).
- **223 shellcheck issues → 0**. 47 `.sh` files renamed to `.py` (per
  shebang), 11 real bug fixes (`pip install pkg[x]>=1.0` interpreted
  as redirection, `trap` quoting, `[ -f X -o -f Y ]` POSIX bug, getopts
  spec duplications in nmap template, etc.) (#768).
- **~60,000 markdownlint errors → 0** across 10,468 files. Bulk
  `--fix` pass (PR #767) handled ~58k mechanical fixes; PR #772
  cleaned the residual 80 (broken anchors in wondelai case-studies via
  TOC-link regeneration, `|` escaping in backtick code spans, table
  column-count fixes, heading-increment demotions, missing image
  alt-text on shield badges).
- **97 codeblock-syntax failures → 0** across SKILL.md / README.md
  files. All were mislabeled language tags: 66 bash blocks that were
  CLI usage with `<placeholder>` brackets (relabeled to `text`), 24
  javascript blocks containing Firestore Security Rules DSL or
  pedagogical vulnerable+secure comparisons, 7 python blocks
  containing ASCII trees / JSON / shell. TypeScript dropped from
  `CHECKABLE` (illustrative fragments reference external types) (#769 and #771).
- **9 plugin-test failures → 0** in `widened-test-loop` across the 10
  candidate plugins (concentrated in `web-to-github-issue`). 4 stale
  error-message expectations updated, 4 `verifyRepo` calls refactored
  to return `{exists: false, error}` instead of throw (cleaner API +
  matched test contract; sanitization preserved), 1 `parseSearchResults`
  test updated to match safer URL-validation behavior (#770).
- **TypeScript coverage**: 9 uncovered packages → 0. Added
  `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"` to 7 MCP packages with existing
  `tsconfig.json`; `audit-typescript-coverage.py` updated to exclude
  `**/assets/**` (illustrative skill-doc examples) and
  `**/.vitepress/**` (docs-site config) (#769).
- **47 `.sh` → `.py` file renames** for mis-extensioned scripts in
  ai-ml/, database/, devops/, productivity/ skill directories (#768).
- **374 Python files reformatted** via `ruff format` for project-wide
  consistency (#765).
- **9 historical AA-AACR session reviews committed** to `000-docs/`
  per #760's allowlist (Lumera memory impl, Beads epic AAR, CLI v2.0
  release, phase 1-6 AARs, metrics canonicalization — all from Dec 2025).
- **148 `implementation.md` files: leading `# Title` → `## Title`**
  to fix MD001 heading-increment violations en masse (#767).
- **6 indented code blocks → fenced** in 3 deprecated `commands/`
  files; 4 setext headings → atx; 3 image alt-text additions.

### Removed

- **~970 MB tracked content + ~1.2 MB working-tree cruft** (#766):
  - `backups/` 882 MB — old migration backups, replaced by git history
  - `functions/` 83 MB — Firebase functions, dead post-VPS-migration
  - `planned-skills/` 4.6 MB — skill-generation scratch
  - `archive/` 416 KB — old release zips
  - `workflows/` 32 KB — legacy bmad metadata
  - `consistency-reports/` 20 KB — one-off audit output
  - `redirects/` 12 KB — empty stub
  - `prompts/` 4 KB — single vertex-life-sciences file
  - Tracked legacy files: `config.zcf.json`, `Dockerfile.test`,
    `docker-compose.test.yml`, `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`,
    `.firebaserc`, `test_youtube_strategy.py`, `setup.sh`,
    `create-tasks.sh`
  - Untracked cruft: `asset_generation*.log` (280 KB), `package.json.tmp`,
    `_PRESERVE_MIGRATION/`, `reports/`, `test-results/`, `claudes-docs/`,
    `__pycache__/`
- **Human-triggered auto-merge** disabled at the repo level
  (`allow_auto_merge=false`). Workflow `maintainer-ready-automerge.yml`
  removed. Only `automerge.yml` for dependabot minor/patch bumps
  remains. Human-author PRs have no auto-merge path (#763).
- **Repo `CLAUDE.md` "Legacy Root Files" section** — no longer
  accurate, nothing legacy at the root.

### Fixed

- **`maintainer-ready-automerge.yml` workflow** removed entirely (#763).
- **`catalog-format-guard` CI step**: `actions/checkout@v6` no longer
  persists credentials reliably for subsequent git-fetch operations.
  Added explicit `fetch-depth: 2` + `persist-credentials: true` to
  the validate job's checkout (#770).
- **`auto-bump-on-pr.yml`** — pre-existing patch-bump automation
  retained, now coexists with the larger blocking-gate stack.

### Security

- All 47 `.sh` files renamed to `.py` (mis-extensioned Python scripts)
  no longer mislead readers about their executable shape.
- Markdownlint enforcement catches `Authorization: Bearer ...` patterns
  in skill docs going forward via the regex-escape fix on table cells.

## [4.31.0] - 2026-05-08

Four-day sprint after v4.30.0 — single-session execution of the "Use the
Printing Press to Learn" plan, which mapped Matt Van Horn's CLI Printing
Press against the IS stack and shipped the four real gaps it surfaced:
generation capability (`/skill-creator --forge`), NOI cultural gate,
JRig behavioral evaluation integration end-to-end, and marketplace trust
signals (JRig-Verified badge + forge-generated provenance pill). The
forge workflow is no longer theoretical — `plugins/productivity/plane/`
is a Grade A (97/100) plugin produced through all 8 forge gates with a
full `.forge/` audit trail. JRig itself got real TypeScript code
(`spec-sources` module + 22 tests, ships in `j-rig-skill-binary-eval`).

### Added

- **`/skill-creator --forge` mode** (local skill, v8.1.0) — 8-gate workflow
  for generating plugins from API surfaces: NOI hard block (the API's
  "secret identity" must be named in 6–10 words before any code is
  written), ecosystem absorb (catalog 3–5 competing tools, gap analysis),
  API surface research, domain archetype detection, compound command
  design, generation, mandatory `/validate-skillmd --thorough`,
  PR + catalog wiring. Produces a `.forge/` audit trail (research.md,
  ecosystem.md, proofs.md) alongside the standard skill scaffold.
- **`/skill-creator --reforge` mode** (local skill, v8.1.0) — Regenerate
  an existing forge-generated plugin against the current API surface to
  fight catalog rot. Preserves NOI from `references/noi.md`, re-runs
  gates 3–7, auto-bumps version per detected change scope (patch for
  endpoint adds, minor for new compound commands, major for breaking
  surface changes).
- **`plugins/productivity/plane/`** (#703) — First end-to-end forge
  dogfood. NOI: "Plane is a team behavior observatory." Five compound
  commands (`/plane-cycle-velocity`, `/plane-stale-tickets`,
  `/plane-reviewer-gate-strength`, `/plane-priority-drift`,
  `/plane-cross-project-load`) that JOIN across multiple Plane endpoints
  to surface observations no single endpoint exposes. Validates Grade A
  (97/100), Tier 2 GREEN, JRig 12/12 deterministic checks. 1,123 lines
  across 8 files; full `.forge/` audit trail visible to anyone reviewing
  how the plugin came to exist.
- **Tier 2 static production gate in the validator** (#698) — Five
  deterministic checks added to `scripts/validate-skills-schema.py` (273
  lines Python). Run alongside the standard 100-point rubric: (1)
  `allowed-tools` accuracy — declared tools must appear in the body;
  (2) auth-documented — API surface mentions require an auth method
  documented; (3) dead-code — literal-false branches detected; (4) tool
  safety — unscoped Bash + Write/WebFetch requires Safety Justification
  section; (5) orchestration bounds — skills shouldn't claim cross-skill
  orchestration (with negation-marker guards to avoid false-positives on
  documentation). 180 new errors surfaced across the 3,535-skill catalog
  on first run; grade distribution unchanged at 68.9% A+B.
- **JRig-Verified marketplace badge data flow** (#696, #699, #700) —
  Three-PR trio that lights up the badge end-to-end: (1) plugin detail
  page renders `plugin.jrig?.verified` as a green "JRig-Verified · N/7
  layers" pill; (2) Freshie schema migration adds `jrig_passed`,
  `jrig_tier_blocked`, `jrig_baseline_delta` columns to `skill_compliance`
  - new `forge_proofs` table for per-plugin verification evidence;
    (3) new build step `enrich-jrig-data.mjs` reads `forge_proofs` via
    sqlite3 CLI, writes `marketplace/src/data/jrig-data.json` for the
    detail-page overlay. Build pipeline now 7 steps (added `jrig:enrich`).
- **Per-plugin `/plugins/<name>/verification` route** (#702) — 316-line
  Astro page that the JRig-Verified badge clicks through to. Two
  states: VERIFIED (shows passing-layer fraction, baseline delta, 7-layer
  framework breakdown) or PENDING (explains the two paths plugins reach
  JRig — forge generation or manual `j-rig eval`).
- **NOI tagline + forge-generated provenance pills** (#696) — Optional
  fields on plugin detail pages: italic NOI-framed subtitle under plugin
  name; indigo "Forge-generated" pill when `plugin.json` carries
  `"generated": true` or `"author_type": "forge"`. Anti-spam moat per
  Phase 5A: marketplace surfaces forge provenance for reviewer + end-user
  visibility.
- **Curated "Start here" homepage section** (#701) — 5-plugin onboarding
  pack between Hero and Jeremy's Stash. Eliminates "what should I
  install?" friction with 343 plugins to choose from. Each card: NOI
  tagline, "why this is in the pack" paragraph, copy-friendly install
  command. Editorial picks; quarterly rotation; re-evaluation against
  install velocity once Phase 5B telemetry lands.
- **JRig spec snapshots in `000-docs/`** (#695) —
  `anthropic-skills-spec-snapshot.md` + `agentskills-spec-snapshot.md`
  capture the source-of-truth specs JRig and the IS validator validate
  against. Versioned; refresh quarterly via PR cadence (live-fetch from
  CI is a rate-limit + flakiness risk). Same files mirror in
  `j-rig-skill-binary-eval/references/specs/`; future enhancement: sync
  script that diffs the two locations and fails CI on divergence.
- **JRig spec-sources TypeScript module** (j-rig PR #41, real TS code) —
  192-line module + 22 passing tests (full repo suite still green at
  173/173). Public API: `loadSpecAuthority()`, `classifyField(name)`,
  `isValidEffort(value)`. Records snapshot IDs so eval reports can detect
  spec drift in either direction. Quarterly refresh becomes a single PR
  cadence with the test suite catching divergence between the snapshot
  files and the embedded TypeScript constants.
- **IS-extension fields documented in `plugin-schema.md`** (#697) — Two
  provenance fields (`generated`: boolean, `author_type`:
  "human" | "forge") set by `/skill-creator --forge`. Documented
  alongside the 15 Anthropic spec fields. Stripped from `marketplace.json`
  (CLI catalog) by `sync-marketplace.cjs`'s `DISALLOWED_KEYS` set so the
  CLI never sees website-only metadata.
- **Master skills spec 3.1.0 → 3.3.1** (#693) —
  `000-docs/6767-b-SPEC-DR-STND-claude-skills-standard.md` brought into
  alignment with the validator's actual schema 3.3.1 behavior: 8-field
  enterprise required set (`name, description, allowed-tools, version,
author, license, compatibility, tags`) is the IS marketplace tier
  requirement; missing any of these = ERROR (not warning). The 3.0.0–
  3.2.0 demotion-to-polish direction was reverted in 3.3.0; the doc never
  absorbed that revert until this PR. `allowed-tools` documented to
  accept all three forms (CSV string, space-separated string, YAML list).
- **Freshie discovery run 7 + compliance population under v7.0** (#694) —
  Refreshed `freshie/inventory.sqlite` with current validator scores.
  Anomalies dropped 44 → 7; duplicate file groups 41 → 0; cross-references
  301 → 684. 2,429 of 3,535 skills (68.9%) production-ready (A+B grade)
  at marketplace tier under schema 3.3.1.

### Changed

- **`scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs` `DISALLOWED_KEYS`** (#697) — Extended
  to strip 4 new website-only display fields from `marketplace.json`:
  `tagline`, `jrig`, `generated`, `author_type`. The website renders
  these from `marketplace.extended.json`; the CLI catalog never sees them.
- **`marketplace/scripts/build.mjs` step count** (#700) — 6 → 7 steps;
  added `jrig:enrich` after `catalog:sync`, before `search:generate`. New
  step reads `forge_proofs` from Freshie and writes `jrig-data.json` for
  the plugin detail page overlay.
- **`/validate-skillmd` v4.0.0 → v5.0.1** (local skill) — Four-tier
  validation framework: Tier 0 (locate), Tier 1 (standard or marketplace
  grading), Tier 2 (static production gate), Tier 3 (JRig opt-in via
  `--thorough`). Reconciled with JRig's actual CLI surface (`j-rig` with
  hyphen, `j-rig check`, `j-rig eval`) after initial documentation
  documented imaginary flags.
- **`/skill-creator` v7.0.0 → v8.1.0** (local skill) — Added `--forge`
  and `--reforge` modes (see Added section). Default `--create` mode
  unchanged for hand-authored skills.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (#704) — Refreshed after the plan landed: plugin count
  425 → 427, schema 3.0.0 → 3.3.1, build pipeline 6 → 7 steps, new
  "Forge-Generated Plugins" subsection documenting `.forge/` pattern,
  new top-level "JRig — Behavioral Evaluation Integration" section
  explaining the full data flow. +70 / -13 lines, 22-section structure
  preserved.

### Fixed

- **JRig epic-index README accuracy** (j-rig PR #40) — The README said
  "Currently Active: Epic 01" with epics 02–10 marked Pending; reality
  was all 10 epics shipped 2026-03-29 at v0.14.0 with 6 CLI commands
  wired. Stale README triggered a false "JRig isn't ready" red-team
  finding in the downstream IS plan. Updated with merge dates per epic
  and a CLI-surface section.
- **Umami custom events + data-domains spam guard** (#692) — Wires
  marketplace events through Umami analytics; adds the data-domains
  guard to the analytics config so spam events don't pollute the
  legitimate signal.
- **Homepage npm-marquee total downloads relabel** (#691) — "30d" →
  "total downloads" reflects what the badge actually shows.
- **npm-stats fetch throttling** (#689) — Restores live total on the
  marquee; throttles fetch to dodge registry rate limits.
- **Homepage 30d total drop** (#688) — Dropped the "last 30d" segment
  from the npm marquee.
- **Header navigation cleanup** (#686) — Removed the ⌘ icon box from
  the header per design review.

### Security

- No new vulnerabilities introduced. Validator's Tier 2 tool-safety
  check now flags unscoped `Bash` + `Write`/`WebFetch` declarations
  without a Safety Justification section as ERROR at marketplace tier
  — surfaces the curl-pipe-shell exploit surface for review on every
  validation run.

## [4.30.0] - 2026-05-04

Two-day sprint following v4.29.0 — landed the same-session "ship workaround
→ file tracking issue → ship the real fix" loop several times in public, plus
the **guidewire-pack v2.0.0 rebuild** (24 skills → 10 production-engineer
skills), a new marketplace plugin (`engineer-design-diagram`), enforcement
of the lessons learned during v4.29.0 (pre-commit hook, sync-marketplace
orchestrator, pre-push warning), and post-release Freshie + compliance work
that surfaced + partially remediated 115 D+F skills.

### Added

- **`engineer-design-diagram` marketplace plugin** (#665) — Ports the global
  skill at `~/.claude/skills/engineer-design-diagram/` (live since 2026-04-19)
  into `plugins/devops/engineer-design-diagram/` so any Claude Code user can
  install it. Generates production-grade architecture/sequence/delta/drift
  diagrams as self-contained dark-themed HTML with inline SVG, grounded in
  real repo topology via DCI. Four modes (`/design:generate`, `/design:diff`,
  `/design:trace`, `/design:watch`). v0.2.0, A-grade (96/100). Closes
  `claude-2rb6.2` and `claude-2rb6.10`.
- **`guidewire-pack v2.0.0`** (#668-#678) — 11-PR coordinated rebuild of the
  Guidewire InsuranceSuite skill pack. **24 skills → 10 production-engineer
  skills**, each addressing real production failure modes. Highlights:
  - Rebuilt to A-grade: `install-auth`, `sdk-patterns`, `local-dev-loop`,
    `core-workflow-a` (PolicyCenter), `core-workflow-b` (ClaimCenter)
  - New unified skills (merging multiple v1 skills):
    `security-and-rbac` (basics + enterprise-rbac),
    `observability-and-incident-response` (3-skill merge),
    `ci-cd-pipeline` (4-skill merge: ci-integration + deploy-integration
    - multi-env-setup + prod-checklist),
      `migration-and-upgrade` (2-skill merge),
      `webhooks-integrations` (rename + deepen of webhooks-events)
  - Cuts (deferred or removed with rationale): `data-handling`,
    `reference-architecture`, `performance-tuning`, `cost-tuning`
  - Pack-level: `package.json` 1.0.x → 2.0.0, README rewritten to 10-skill
    production-problem framing
- **`contributing-clanker` v0.1.x community plugin** — New scaffold under
  `plugins/community/`, three patch releases (v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.1.2) over
  the two days for runtime correctness fixes synced to the marketplace.
- **Repo-wide automation** (#667) — `pnpm run sync-marketplace` is now an
  orchestrator that chains `sync-marketplace.cjs` + `generate-plugin-package-jsons.mjs`
  - `generate-readme-toc.mjs`. New pre-commit hook auto-runs the chain when
    `marketplace.extended.json` is staged and auto-stages derived files. New
    pre-push hook warns when the local branch is behind `origin/main`. The
    legacy single-step JSON-strip is preserved as `pnpm run sync-marketplace:json-only`.
- **2026-05-03 case study** (`marketplace/src/content/blog-posts/`) —
  Tier-3 case study post on the v4.29.0 release ceremony + the same-session
  loop closure pattern.

### Fixed

- **README ↔ Prettier ↔ generator 3-authority conflict** (#658) — Closes
  issue #657 in the same session it was opened. Both
  `scripts/generate-readme-toc.mjs` and `scripts/render-spotlight.mjs` now
  pipe their spliced output through `prettier.format()` (with
  `prettier.resolveConfig()` for project settings) before writing/comparing.
  Removes the README.md exclusion from `.prettierignore`. All three gates
  (`prettier --check`, generator `--check` modes) pass simultaneously, in any
  order. Workaround → real-fix loop closed in ~2 hours.
- **D+F skill remediation, partial** (#661) — Schema 3.3.1's stricter rubric
  surfaced 115 D+F skills (regression from the post-v4.24.0 "Zero D/F"
  baseline). Added `tags` + `compatibility` frontmatter to **102 skills**
  missing both fields (94 in `plugins/ai-agency/tonone/`, 8 across
  saas-packs). Result: 115 → 89 D+F (-26 grade improvements). Remaining 89
  are score 67-69 (1-3 points below C threshold) blocked by missing
  `references/`, `examples/`, `scripts/` subdirectories — a SaaS pack
  scaffolding template defect tracked in #660.
- **Post-v4.29.0 quality sweep** (#656) — Cleared pre-existing ESLint errors
  (`scripts/bulk-bump-versions.mjs:277` control-char regex,
  `scripts/check-official-links.mjs:138` unnecessary-escape) that the new
  root config from #629 surfaced for the first time. Plus a repo-wide
  Prettier `--write` sweep (40 files, all cosmetic — `*em*` → `_em_`,
  blank-line normalization). Plus `jeremy-adk-software-engineer` description
  no longer claims "placeholder - to be implemented" (the skill ships real
  content). Plus `repository`/`homepage`/`bugs` added to root `package.json`
  for npm provenance metadata.

### Changed

- **Freshie discovery run 6** (#659) — First inventory refresh since
  2026-04-06 (run 5). Captures the post-v4.29.0 ecosystem state on commit
  `531631f9d`: 17 packs / 423 plugins / 3,000 skills / 7,800 files.
  Compliance grade distribution: A 25.6% / B 42.9% / C 28.9% / D 2.5% / F
  0.0%. Average score 84.1/100. SQLite DB grew 53 MB → 63 MB (over GitHub's
  50 MB recommended limit; LFS plan tracked in #660). Surfaced three real
  issues hidden by the staleness — D+F regression, three-different-skill-counts
  inconsistency, and DB size — all with acceptance criteria documented in
  #660.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** updated:
  - "Two Catalog System" section explains the new sync-marketplace as
    orchestrator (the three chained steps + when to use the json-only variant)
  - "Auto-Generated Data Files" table now lists `plugins/**/package.json`
    and the README TOC block as chained from sync-marketplace
  - New "Git Hooks" section documents pre-commit + pre-push behavior +
    bypass instructions

### Tracking

- Issue #657 (closed by #658) — README.md generator/Prettier 3-authority conflict
- Issue #660 (open) — Post-Freshie-run-6 follow-ups (D+F regression second
  half, 250 orphan skills + 19 duplicate slugs catalog hygiene, Freshie LFS
  plan, Freshie compliance-snapshot design quirk)

## [4.29.0] - 2026-05-02

This release bundles a major validator overhaul (schema 3.3.1), a fleet-wide
`compatible-with` → `compatibility` migration across ~3,200 skills, the testing
infrastructure rollout (husky, lint-staged, commitlint, audit-harness, a11y,
RTM/PERSONAS/JOURNEYS), the npm publish pipeline that broke the v1.0.0 freeze,
the Umami analytics tracker, two new external plugin sources (Skyvern,
ali5ter/claude-workflow-skills), and a long tail of CI hardening + sync-workflow
fixes. The validator section below is the original 4.29.0 entry from 2026-04-28
(the version was documented but never tagged); everything in subsequent sections
landed between 2026-04-28 and 2026-05-02 and is included in this release.

---

### Added (post-2026-04-28)

- **Release automation pipeline** (#647) — Broke the v1.0.0 plugin-freeze by adding three workflows: `auto-bump-on-pr.yml` (per-PR patch bumps for changed plugins), `publish-changed-packages.yml` (per-merge `npm publish --provenance` + per-package git tags + GitHub Releases), and a one-shot `publish-all-packages.yml` recovery workflow. Per-package tag convention is `@scope/name@version`. Full operator flow lives in `RELEASING.md`.
- **Umami analytics tracker** (#651) — Wired into `BaseLayout.astro` via env-driven script tag (`UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` + `UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL`). Fail-soft: missing env = no tracker, no console error. Closes the empty-data gap that the `/analytics` skill kept hitting.
- **Testing infrastructure rollout** (#621, #629, #631) — Three-PR sequence installing the canonical Intent Solutions testing stack:
  - `@intentsolutions/audit-harness` as a dev dependency, `tests/TESTING.md` policy doc, coverage thresholds, hash-pinning manifest (#621)
  - Husky + lint-staged + commitlint + root ESLint/Prettier on every commit/PR (#629)
  - Marketplace a11y suite, RTM/PERSONAS/JOURNEYS files, CLI performance budget (#631)
- **External plugin sources** — Two new third-party repos added to the daily sync:
  - Skyvern (browser-automation MCP) — `productivity/skyvern` (#547, #650)
  - `ali5ter/claude-workflow-skills` (#649)
- **Killer Skill of the Week tooling** (#648) — Promoted Skyvern. Added `scripts/promote-spotlight.mjs` (atomic rotation: previous spotlight → top of hallOfFame) + `scripts/render-spotlight.mjs` (generates the README KILLER-SKILL block from `marketplace/src/data/spotlights.json`). CI enforces drift between `spotlights.json` and the README block.
- **Blog content** — Two case-study posts to `tonsofskills.com/blog`: `vps-as-the-home-day-1` (Contabo VPS migration program kickoff) and `propagation-day` (the harness/skills version-lock pattern). Plus 6 backfilled engineering posts covering 2026-04-23 → 2026-04-29 (#632).
- **ADRs declining audit-tests roadmap recommendations** (#619) — Four architectural decision records explaining why specific audit-tests roadmap items are not adopted in this repo.

### Fixed (post-2026-04-28)

- **Hero marquees** (#653) — Vertical spacing tightened and partner/npm-stats scroll speeds normalized so neither marquee runs in a visible "wait then jump" pattern.
- **`update-npm-stats` accuracy + Slack channel hygiene** (#646) — Drift fixes for `marketplace/src/data/npm-stats.json` (rate-limit was undercounting on retries), and the daily Slack download digest now posts to the correct channel only.
- **Orphaned plugins exposed** — `jeremy-google-adk` and `jeremy-vertex-ai` were on disk but absent from the catalog (#634, closes #597). Plus `plugins/**/skills/` orphan paths cleaned up + stragglers migrated to `compatibility` (#644, closes #630).
- **`x-bug-triage` SKILL.md compliance** (#633) — Five files brought to marketplace tier (frontmatter + body fixes).
- **Sync-external workflow stabilized** — Six-PR sequence working through cascading failures in the daily external-source sync workflow:
  - Replaced `peter-evans/create-pull-request` with hand-rolled `gh pr create` (#642) — eliminated the GHA-bot signature mismatch that was breaking branch protection
  - Disabled husky in the auto-PR step (#639) — pre-commit hook was rejecting bot commits
  - Switched to `--no-frozen-lockfile` for post-sync installs (#638) — synced packages can introduce dep changes
  - Graceful handling of empty files, submodules, and partial-failure scenarios (#637)
  - Workspace-aware install instead of bare `pnpm add` (#636)
  - Removed the duplicate pnpm version pin (#635) — was conflicting with the root `packageManager` field
- **Freshie anomaly detector + populator drift** (#618) — Run-versioning now correctly stamps `run_id` and normalizes paths. `x-bug-triage` template hardened.

### Changed (post-2026-04-28)

- **`compatible-with` → `compatibility` fleet migration** (#620, #622–#628) — The schema 3.3.1 migration from the original 4.29.0 work was applied across the entire skill catalog in eight batches: `ai-ml` category (34 skills, #620), 18 other categories (300 skills, #622), saas-packs 1/6 through 6/6 (~2,500 skills total, #623–#628). Total: ~2,850 skills now use the AgentSkills.io free-text `compatibility` field. The IS-invented closed-CSV `compatible-with` field is fully deprecated repo-wide; it still parses with a deprecation warning for any external sync that drags in legacy frontmatter.
- **Doc-filing standard v4.3** (#640) — Pulled the latest standard from `~/.claude/skills/doc-filing` and fixed a `.gitignore` re-include bug that was hiding `000-docs/*.md` files from `git status` after standard-driven renames.
- **CI: trust Gemini workspace + install bun for mcp-plugins tests** (#617) — Gemini PR Reviewer's GCP workspace is now in the trusted list; the mcp-plugins matrix job installs `bun` so the deno-style test entry-points actually run.

---

### Validator: spec-compliance fixes + `compatible-with` → `compatibility` migration

This release lands on **schema 3.3.1** of the validator after a one-day churn that
went through schema versions 3.0 → 3.1 → 3.2 before stabilizing. The full
back-and-forth is preserved in [`000-docs/SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md`](000-docs/SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md)
including a "Non-negotiables" section and a "How we got here — the 2026-04-28
schema debacle" post-mortem so the same dance doesn't get repeated.

The IS enterprise standard (8 required fields at marketplace tier — `name`,
`description`, `allowed-tools`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `compatibility`,
`tags`) is **unchanged**. Earlier intra-day attempts to relax this to Anthropic's
2-field spec floor were reverted.

### Changed

- **`compatible-with` → `compatibility`** — the IS-invented closed-CSV platform list (`compatible-with: claude-code, codex, openclaw`) is replaced by the AgentSkills.io free-text `compatibility` field (max 500 chars per spec). Old field still parses as a deprecated alias with a per-file migration suggestion. New ALWAYS_REQUIRED set substitutes `compatibility` for `compatible-with`. This is the only structural change to ALWAYS_REQUIRED in this release.
- **Validator script v6.0 → v7.0** — spec-source citations updated, deprecation messaging cleaned up.

### Fixed (spec-compliance bugs)

- **`allowed-tools` accepts YAML list** per `code.claude.com/docs/en/skills` ("Accepts a space-separated string or a YAML list"). Old validator rejected YAML lists with _"must be a comma-separated string (CSV)"_.
- **`allowed-tools` parses space-separated form** per Anthropic's canonical example `Bash(git add *) Bash(git commit *) Bash(git status *)`. Old parser only split on commas. New parser is paren-depth-aware so multi-word tools stay as one token.
- **`when_to_use` reclassified as documented Anthropic optional** — earlier IS rubrics flagged it as deprecated, but Anthropic documents it explicitly. Validator now only warns when combined `description` + `when_to_use` exceeds the 1,536-char listing cap.
- **`agent` field no longer triggers "missing" warning when defaulting** — Anthropic doc states _"If omitted, uses general-purpose"_. Old validator warned that `agent` was missing whenever `context: fork` was set.
- **`argument-hint` conditional** — was incorrectly suppressed by `disable-model-invocation: true`, but the user can still invoke via `/`, so the hint is still relevant. Now tied to `user-invocable=true` only.

### Added

- **`scripts/batch-remediate.py`** — bulk-fix script for spec migrations. `--migrate-compatible-with` flag translates `compatible-with: claude-code, codex` → `compatibility: Designed for Claude Code, also compatible with Codex` per AgentSkills.io spec. Idempotent — safe to run twice.
- **`arguments`, `paths`, `shell` added to schema registry** — all documented Anthropic optional fields that were missing from `SKILL_FIELDS`. Type-validated.
- **`effort: xhigh`** added to valid values per Anthropic doc (`low/medium/high/xhigh/max`).
- **`${CLAUDE_EFFORT}`** added to `YAML_VALUE_ALLOWED_VARS` substitution allow-list.
- **`Skill()` permission rule documentation** in `references/frontmatter-spec.md` (`Skill(name)` exact match, `Skill(name *)` prefix match, `Skill` deny-all).
- **`000-docs/SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md`** — new doc tracking validator schema versions independently from this main CHANGELOG. Includes the "Non-negotiables" rules and the "2026-04-28 schema debacle" post-mortem.

### Important: what was NOT changed (and won't be without explicit approval)

Per the new "Non-negotiables" section in `SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md`:

- `ALWAYS_REQUIRED` is the IS enterprise 8-field set. Not reducible to Anthropic's 2-field spec floor without explicit user approval.
- Marketplace tier produces ERRORS for missing required fields, not warnings.
- The IS rubric SITS ON TOP of Anthropic's spec — additive, never subtractive.
- Tracking metadata (`version`, `author`, `license`) is REQUIRED at marketplace tier, not optional polish.

### Migration

Skills using the deprecated `compatible-with` field continue to validate (with a deprecation warning). Bulk-migrate via:

```bash
python3 scripts/batch-remediate.py --migrate-compatible-with --root <path>
```

Migration translation table:

```diff
 ---
 name: my-skill
 description: Does the thing. Use when ...
-compatible-with: claude-code, codex, openclaw
+compatibility: Designed for Claude Code, also compatible with Codex and OpenClaw
 ---
```

The 3,385 public-repo `SKILL.md` files under `plugins/` are **not** migrated in this release. Bulk migration tracked in #610.

### Tracking issue

[#610](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/issues/610) — `[spec] Realign skill validator + master spec to Anthropic's authoritative sources`. Note: the issue title still says "Realign" — the actual outcome was "fix bugs and add tooling without realigning." See `000-docs/SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md` for the corrected story.

## [4.28.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Gemini PR Review revival** (#602) — Fixed a 4-month silent-fail regression. Workflow was running green on every PR but posting zero review comments because of a broken MCP bridge pattern. Full fix:
  - Switched trigger from `pull_request` → `pull_request_target` so fork-PRs actually get CI + Gemini feedback (previously fork PRs received zero feedback of any kind)
  - SHA-pinned checkout of PR HEAD with `persist-credentials: false` for safe fork-PR handling
  - Extended `.gemini/commands/gemini-review.toml` with an "Intent Solutions Philosophy" section so Gemini frames failures in the context of the marketplace's enterprise-grade bar
  - Updated the prompt to lead with validator failures and link CONTRIBUTING.md anchors rather than re-explaining rules inline
  - Added Slack notification step on every review completion (pings `#operation-hired`)
- **Plane sync workflow** (#529) — New GitHub Actions workflow syncing CCP issues to `projects.intentsolutions.io` Plane project. Fires on `issues: opened` (creates matching Plane issue in Backlog) and `pull_request: closed` (parses close refs, flips Plane issues to Done)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md "Before You Submit" section** (#602) — Top-of-file philosophy framing that sets expectations upfront about the Intent Solutions "ship the full-capability version" standard
- **CODEOWNERS** (#602) — Jeremy as sole owner on every path, with emphasis paths (`.github/`, `.gemini/`, validator scripts, catalog files, dependency manifests). Combined with branch protection "require code owner reviews", external contributions cannot merge without his approval
- **Blog backfill** — 4 posts cross-posted from `startaitools.com` (Apr 19-22 window)
- **External audit response (NLPM, xiaolai)** — Expanded validator and CI coverage in response to the NLPM audit (issue #540).
  - `scripts/validate-skills-schema.py` now scans `.claude/agents/` and `workspace/**/agents/` in addition to `plugins/`, and flags shell-substitution patterns (`$(...)`, backticks, unguarded `${VAR}`) in YAML frontmatter values
  - `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml` PR trigger paths extended to `scripts/**`, `.claude/**`, and `workspace/**`
  - Credit to [xiaolai](https://github.com/xiaolai), author of [NLPM](https://github.com/xiaolai/nlpm-for-claude), for the audit and fix PRs (#535-#539)

### Changed

- **PR template callout** (#602) — Top-of-file disclosure pointing first-time contributors at the CONTRIBUTING.md philosophy section
- **`maintainer-ready-automerge.yml` triple-guarded** (#602) — Fires only on `labeled` event (not synchronize/reopened/ready_for_review), only when the label is exactly `maintainer-ready`, AND only when the sender is `jeremylongshore`
- **Marketplace playbooks layout** (#601) — Wrapped in `BaseLayout`; retired `/spotlight` page
- **`ccpi validate --strict` step** (#603, #604) — Temporarily degraded from `|| exit 1` to `|| true` in `validate-plugins.yml` to unblock CI while 177-agent pre-existing frontmatter debt is worked off over a multi-PR campaign. Reversal tracked in #604; hard gate returns once debt is cleared

### Fixed

- **Frontmatter cleanup campaign — Phase 1** (#604, #605) — 5 pre-existing errors: 4 shipwright command categories (`ai-agency` → `deployment`) and 1 over-length `backup-strategy` description (158 → 80 chars). 182 → 177 `ccpi validate --strict` errors
- **Frontmatter cleanup campaign — Phase 2A batch 1** (#604, #606) — 12 files in `fullstack-starter-pack` (6 top-level + 6 byte-identical nested mirrors) brought to production-grade frontmatter. 177 → 170
- **Frontmatter cleanup campaign — Phase 2A batch 2** (#604, #607) — 11 agents in `testing/code-cleanup` backfilled with capabilities + model + expertise_level. 170 → 159
- **Skills `allowed-tools` errors** (#603) — 3 pre-existing errors: `freshie-inventory-manager` used unknown `Agent` tool (→ `Task`); `sentry-pack` and `supabase-pack` had malformed wildcards missing colons (`Bash(python*)` → `Bash(python:*)`, `Bash(npx supabase *)` → `Bash(npx supabase:*)`)
- **Freshie compliance populator** (#593) — Stamps `run_id` and normalizes paths for correct run-versioning
- **Agent frontmatter quoting** (#579) — `phase_*.md` descriptions now properly quoted to avoid YAML mapping errors
- **`quick-test.sh`** (#538) — Replaced silent global `pnpm install` with a clear prerequisite error
- **Schema-optimization phase agents** (#536) — Added missing YAML frontmatter
- **fairdb-setup-backup webhook guard** (#539) — `curl` now guarded by env-var presence check
- **`backup-strategy.md`** (#537) — Replaced shell-substitution expressions in frontmatter
- **skill-auditor agent** (#535) — Added missing YAML frontmatter
- **Plane sync jq injection** (#529) — `$SEQ` now passed as jq `--arg` variable instead of shell-interpolated (defensive security fix per Gemini review)
- **Cloud Functions Slack webhook logging** — Webhook failures now surface in logs instead of silently swallowing

### Security

- **Secret scanning hardened** — Replaced the previous regex-based secret scan in `validate-plugins.yml` with a dedicated workflow (`secret-scan.yml`) that runs `gitleaks` on every PR and push, plus a weekly `trufflehog` verified-credentials scan with Slack alerting. `.gitleaks.toml` adds rules for Anthropic, Groq, and Firebase/GCP credential shapes on top of the upstream defaults
- **Gemini reviewer WIF binding narrowed** (#602) — Service account IAM binding tightened from `attribute.repository_owner/jeremylongshore` (org-wide) to `attribute.repository/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills` (this repo only). Fully standalone GCP isolation across every layer
- **Branch protection hardened** (#602) — `require_code_owner_reviews: true`, `dismiss_stale_reviews: true`, 1 approval required. Combined with CODEOWNERS, no PR merges without Jeremy's approval

### Known issues

- **171 pre-existing agent frontmatter errors** tracked in #604 as a multi-PR cleanup campaign. `ccpi validate --strict` is currently reporting-only (`|| true`) until the campaign completes; strict enforcement returns when the final campaign PR restores `|| exit 1`
