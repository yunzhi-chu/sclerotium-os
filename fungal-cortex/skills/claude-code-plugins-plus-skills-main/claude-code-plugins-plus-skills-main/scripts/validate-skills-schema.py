Claude Code Plugin Validator v7.0 (Anthropic-Aligned Two-Tier Schema)

Unified validator for all Claude Code plugin content:
- SKILL.md files (Agent Skills)
- commands/*.md files (Slash Commands)
- agents/*.md files (Custom Agents)

Two-tier validation system (aligned with Anthropic published spec):
- Standard (DEFAULT): Mirrors Anthropic spec exactly. Required: name + description only.
  All other fields optional. Type/value validation when fields are present.
- Marketplace (--marketplace): IS enterprise standard. All 8 ALWAYS_REQUIRED fields
  (name, description, allowed-tools, version, author, license, compatibility, tags)
  must be present — missing any of them is an ERROR (schema 3.3.0+; see
  000-docs/SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md NON-NEGOTIABLES #1-#2). 100-point rubric.
- Deep (--deep): Intent Solutions Deep Evaluation Engine. 10 weighted dimensions.
- Auto-detect: if CI=true or GITHUB_ACTIONS=true → marketplace by default.

The legacy --enterprise flag is a deprecated alias for --marketplace.

Schema registry sources (all 7 verified 2026-04-28):
- platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview      (name+description required)
- platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices (name+description required)
- code.claude.com/docs/en/skills                                          (description recommended)
- code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference                               (no extra SKILL.md fields)
- anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-...       (name+description required)
- agentskills.io/specification                                            (compatibility, metadata are optional)
- github.com/anthropics/skills                                            (reference impl)

# === CONSTANTS ===

# Schema version (independent of validator script version).
# 3.0.0 (2026-04-28) — attempted realignment to Anthropic spec; reduced
#                       required fields to {name, description}. REVERTED in 3.3.0.
# 3.1.0 (2026-04-28) — added when_to_use, arguments, paths, shell to SKILL_FIELDS;
#                       effort valid values include xhigh. (These technical
#                       additions are kept in 3.3.0.)
# 3.2.0 (2026-04-28) — reframed tier model around tracking metadata. REVERTED in 3.3.0.
# 3.3.0 (2026-04-28) — restored 8-field enterprise standard (name, description,
#                       allowed-tools, version, author, license, compatibility, tags).
#                       compatible-with → compatibility migration is the only kept
#                       change from the 3.0–3.2 experiments. when_to_use, arguments,
#                       paths, shell, effort:xhigh additions are also kept.
# 3.3.1 (2026-04-28) — Claude Code extension audit: fixed `allowed-tools` to accept
#                       YAML lists AND space-separated strings per Anthropic spec
#                       (was rejecting YAML lists, was only splitting on commas);
#                       relaxed CONDITIONAL_FIELDS for `agent` (defaults to
#                       general-purpose per spec — not a missing-field warning);
#                       fixed `argument-hint` conditional (disable-model-invocation
#                       doesn't affect /-menu visibility); added ${CLAUDE_EFFORT} to
#                       YAML_VALUE_ALLOWED_VARS.
# 3.7.0 (2026-05-28) — Claude Code v2.1.152 (released 2026-05-27) added
#                       `disallowed-tools` to SKILL.md frontmatter. Recognized as
#                       Anthropic-source optional field with same string|array shape
#                       as `allowed-tools`. Per SAK plan 031 § 14.10 binding, lands
#                       at IS marketplace tier (NOT spec-floor recognition).
#                       Snapshot anchor: intent-eval-platform/intent-eval-lab/research/
#                       claude-docs-spec-tree-2026-05-27.md.
# 3.8.0 (2026-06-11) — allowed-tools entry validation made real (was
#                       always-True with diagnostics silently dropped):
#                       malformed entries (unbalanced parens, empty scope,
#                       illegal tool-name characters) and unknown tool names
#                       now surface as WARNINGS at all tiers; standard tier
#                       now emits a missing-'name' warning (was silent);
#                       stale "marketplace = warnings-only" docstrings
#                       corrected. No change to ALWAYS_REQUIRED or
#                       error-vs-warning semantics.

# code.claude.com/docs/en/skills:
#   - `agent` defaults to `general-purpose` when `context: fork` is set
#     ("If omitted, uses general-purpose"). NOT required — recommended only
#     when the engineer wants a non-default agent type.
#   - `context` is only meaningful when `agent` is intentionally set;
#     setting `agent` without `context: fork` makes the agent field a no-op.
#   - `argument-hint` is shown in the `/` autocomplete menu, which only
#     applies when `user-invocable: true` (the default). `disable-model-
#     invocation: true` doesn't affect the / menu — only Claude's auto-load,
#     so it should NOT be in this conditional.

# === KERNEL SHADOW (DR-049 — advisory, never gating) ====================
# The Spec Authority Kernel (@intentsolutions/core, pinned exactly in
# package.json) publishes the machine-spec skill-frontmatter contract at
# schemas/authoring/v1/. The effective required set is the union of the
# upstream-base layer's `required` (agentskills.io standardFloor) and the
# is-overlay layer's `required` (the IS marketplace promotions/inventions).
# At runtime the validator can COMPARE that derived set against the
# hand-authored ALWAYS_REQUIRED above (which stays AUTHORITATIVE — this is
# a shadow, not a cutover; the flip is gated on the DR-049 soak). [11hl]
