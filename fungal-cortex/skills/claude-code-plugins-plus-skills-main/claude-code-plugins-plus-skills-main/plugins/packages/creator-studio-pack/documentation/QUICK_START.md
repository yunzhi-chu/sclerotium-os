# Creator Studio Pack - Quick Start Guide

**Create your first video in 30 minutes**

---

## The 30-Minute Challenge

Go from code to published video in half an hour. Here's how.

---

## Scenario: "I Just Built a Feature"

Let's say you just implemented Redis caching that made your API 10x faster. Perfect video content. Let's turn it into a viral tutorial.

---

## Timeline

**Minutes 0-5: Document Your Build**
**Minutes 5-15: Record Screen + Write Script**
**Minutes 15-25: Edit Automatically**
**Minutes 25-30: Publish Everywhere**

---

## Step-by-Step

### Minutes 0-5: Capture Your Work

1. **Enable Build Logging**

   ```bash
   # Talk to build-logger-agent
   "Start documenting my Redis caching work"
   ```

2. **Commit Your Code**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Redis caching layer - 10x performance improvement"
   git push
   ```

3. **Build Logger Analyzes**

   ```
   BUILD LOG - Day 15

   ### Redis Caching Implementation ✅
   What: Integrated Redis for API response caching
   Why: Response times were 2000ms, now 180ms
   Hero Moment 🎬: 11x improvement - perfect for video!

   Video Idea: "I Made My API 10x Faster in 1 Hour"
   Estimated Views: 50K-200K
   ```

**Result**: You have structured notes about what you built and why it matters.

---

### Minutes 5-15: Record & Script

1. **Start Recording**

   ```bash
   /record start redis-tutorial
   ```

   ```
   🔴 Screen recording started
   Recording to: ~/Videos/redis-tutorial/raw/2025-10-11-14-30-redis-tutorial.mp4
   ```

2. **Show Your Work (10 minutes)**
   - Open your code in VS Code
   - Show the slow API (before)
   - Walk through your Redis implementation
   - Show the fast API (after)
   - Mark key moments:

     ```bash
     /record mark "Before: 2000ms response time"
     /record mark "Redis integration code"
     /record mark "After: 180ms response time - 11x faster!"
     ```

3. **Stop Recording**

   ```bash
   /record stop
   ```

   ```
   ✅ Recording saved: ~/Videos/redis-tutorial/raw/2025-10-11-14-30-redis-tutorial.mp4
   Duration: 10:23
   Markers: 3
   Ready for editing
   ```

4. **Generate Video Script (concurrent with recording)**

   ```bash
   # Talk to code-explainer-video agent while you record
   "Create a video script for my Redis caching implementation.
   Target audience: web developers.
   Key points: slow API problem, Redis solution, 11x performance improvement."
   ```

   **Agent Output:**

   ```markdown
   VIDEO SCRIPT: "I Made My API 10x Faster in 1 Hour"

   HOOK (0:00-0:15):
   "My API was taking 2 seconds per request. Watch me make it 200ms."

   [Full script generated with shot list]
   ```

**Result**: You have raw footage and a polished script.

---

### Minutes 15-25: Automated Editing

1. **Edit Video with AI**

   ```bash
   # Talk to video-editor-ai agent
   "Edit my redis-tutorial recording:
   - Remove all silence over 2 seconds
   - Use my 3 markers as key moments
   - Add Mr Beast style subtitles
   - Export for YouTube (1080p)"
   ```

   **Agent Processing:**

   ```
   ✅ Analyzing footage... (10 seconds analyzed)
   ✅ Removed 47 seconds of silence
   ✅ Cut at 3 marker points
   ✅ Added subtitles (Mr Beast style)
   ✅ Color grading applied
   ✅ Exporting... (1080p, 60fps, H.264)

   ✅ Edited video saved: ~/Videos/redis-tutorial/final/redis-tutorial-final.mp4
   Duration: 8:47 (from 10:23 raw)
   File size: 412 MB
   ```

2. **Create Thumbnail**

   ```bash
   /thumbnail "I Made My API 10x Faster in 1 Hour"
   ```

   **Generated 3 variations:**

   ```
   1. Before/After comparison (2000ms → 180ms)
   2. Bold text "10x FASTER" with code background
   3. Face + performance graph split

   Saved to: ~/Videos/redis-tutorial/thumbnails/
   Predicted CTR: 8-12% (Variation 1 recommended)
   ```

3. **Optimize Title**

    ```bash
    /optimize-title "I Made My API 10x Faster in 1 Hour"
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```
    OPTIMIZED TITLE:
    "I Made My API 10x Faster in 1 Hour (Redis Tutorial)"

    CTR Score: 9/10
    Why: Specific result + time frame + keyword
    ```

4. **Generate SEO Metadata**

    ```bash
    /metadata "I Made My API 10x Faster in 1 Hour (Redis Tutorial)"
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```yaml
    Description: |
      My API was painfully slow. Every request took 2 seconds...
      [Full optimized description with timestamps, links, tags]

    Tags: redis, api optimization, caching, performance, tutorial...
    ```

**Result**: You have a polished, edited video with optimized metadata.

### Minutes 25-30: Publish Everywhere

1. **Distribute Automatically**

    ```bash
    # Talk to distribution-automator agent
    "Publish my redis-tutorial video to all platforms.

    Thumbnail: variation 1
    Schedule for tomorrow at 10am EST"
    ```

    **Agent Processing:**

## Next Steps

### Make It Even Better

**Add these for higher quality:**

1. **Webcam overlay** (5 extra minutes)

   ```bash
   /record start redis-tutorial --webcam
   # Shows your face picture-in-picture
   ```

2. **Voiceover narration** (10 extra minutes)

   ```bash
   /teleprompter ~/Videos/redis-tutorial/script.md
   # Read your script with auto-scroll teleprompter
   ```

3. **Progress visuals** (2 extra minutes)

   ```bash
   /progress speed
   # Generates before/after performance charts
   ```

### Batch Production (7 videos in 3.5 hours)

Once you're comfortable, scale up:

```bash
# Talk to batch-recording-scheduler agent
"Plan a batch recording session.
I have 7 video ideas from this week's commits."
```

**Agent Output:**

```

## Common Workflows

### Daily: Build Log

```bash
# Automatic - just commit your code
git commit -m "feat: meaningful message"
# Build logger captures everything
```

### Weekly: Content Creation

```bash
# 1. Review what you built
"Build logger, what video ideas do I have from this week?"

# 2. Batch record (3 hours)
/record start [video-1]
/record start [video-2]
/record start [video-3]

# 3. Batch edit (1 hour)
"Video editor, process all my recordings from today"

# 4. Publish (5 minutes)
"Distribution automator, publish all edited videos on Tuesday 10am"
```

### Monthly: Strategy Review

```bash
/analytics 30
# See what's working
# Double down on winners
# Adjust content calendar
```

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Don't worry about perfection on video 1
2. **Mark moments while recording** - Use `/record mark` generously
3. **Let AI edit** - Trust the automated editing (you can refine later)
4. **Publish consistently** - 1-2 videos per week beats sporadic 10-video dumps
5. **Analyze and iterate** - Use `/analytics` to see what works

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My video is too long after editing**

```bash
# Talk to video-editor-ai
"Re-edit my video to under 10 minutes. Be more aggressive with cuts."
```

**Q: Thumbnail CTR is low**

```bash
/thumbnail "My Video Title" --style mr-beast
# Try more aggressive style
```

**Q: Video isn't getting views**

```bash
/optimize-title "My Current Title"
# Get better title suggestions

/metadata "My Video" --trending
# Optimize for trending keywords
```

**Q: I don't have time for video**

```bash
# Talk to batch-recording-scheduler
"I have 2 hours next Saturday. Plan max content output."
# Agent optimizes for your constraints
```
