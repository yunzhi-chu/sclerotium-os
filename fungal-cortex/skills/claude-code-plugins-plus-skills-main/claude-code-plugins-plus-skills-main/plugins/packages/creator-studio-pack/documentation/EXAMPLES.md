2. **Adjust time estimates**: First videos take longer, get faster with practice
3. **Mix content types**: Don't only do tutorials or only build logs
4. **Follow your build log**: Let `build-logger-agent` suggest what to film
5. **Repurpose everything**: Every long video becomes 10+ short pieces
6. **Batch similar content**: Record multiple tutorials in one session
7. **Learn from analytics**: Double down on what performs well
