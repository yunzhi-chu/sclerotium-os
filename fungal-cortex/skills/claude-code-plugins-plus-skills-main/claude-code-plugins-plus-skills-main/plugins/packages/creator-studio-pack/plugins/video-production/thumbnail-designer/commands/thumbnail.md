## Platform-Specific Optimization

Different platforms need different approaches:

**YouTube (1280x720)**

```
- Large text (readable at 100px preview)
- High contrast
- Face recommended (if available)
- 3-7 words max
- File size: <2MB
```

**TikTok/Shorts (1080x1920 cover)**

```
- Vertical format
- Face in upper 60%
- Large text in safe zone
- Bright colors
- File size: <500KB
```

**LinkedIn (1200x627)**

```
- Professional appearance
- Clean design
- Text-heavy acceptable
- Business colors
- File size: <5MB
```

**Twitter (1200x675)**

```
- Punchy text
- Eye-catching
- Works without context
- File size: <5MB
```

## Best Practices

### Text Guidelines

- **3-7 words maximum** - Any more is too busy
- **Readable at 100px** - Most people see small previews
- **High contrast** - White text, dark stroke + shadow
- **Split long titles** - Focus on hook, not full title

### Face Guidelines

- **Expression matters** - Shocked, happy, or focused
- **30-40% of frame** - Large enough to see emotion
- **Eye contact** - Looking at camera is best
- **Good lighting** - Front-lit, no harsh shadows

### Color Guidelines

- **High contrast** - Visible in any context
- **3 colors max** - More is chaotic
- **Brand consistency** - Use same palette across videos
- **Test in grayscale** - Should work without color

## Integration Points

Works with other Creator Studio plugins:

- **title-optimizer**: Get optimized title for thumbnail text
- **analytics-insights**: A/B test thumbnail performance
- **distribution-automator**: Auto-upload with video

## Troubleshooting

### Text Too Small on Mobile

```
⚠️ Warning: Text may be hard to read on mobile

Current: 72pt font at 1280x720
Recommended: 96pt minimum

Auto-fix: Increase font to 96pt? (y/n)
```

### Low Contrast Warning

```
⚠️ Low contrast detected (4.2:1 ratio)

Current: Light blue text on blue background
Recommended: 7:1 minimum for accessibility

Suggestions:
- Add black stroke (3-4px)
- Add drop shadow
- Darken background
- Use white text instead
```

### Face Detection Failed

```
❌ No face detected in image

Troubleshooting:
- Ensure face is visible and front-on
- Check image isn't too dark
- Try a different photo
- Use manual positioning with --face-coords
```

Your goal: Create scroll-stopping thumbnails that get clicks and accurately represent your video content.
