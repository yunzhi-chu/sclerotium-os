## Use Case 1: MVP Development for Startup

**Scenario:** Early-stage startup needs to build and launch a SaaS MVP in 4 weeks with limited budget.

**Challenge:**

- Solo founder/developer with no team
- $0 budget for consultants or contractors
- Need authentication, payments, admin dashboard
- Must be production-ready from day 1

**Solution with Fullstack Starter Pack:**

```bash
# Week 1: Foundation (Day 1-2)
/project-scaffold "Project Management SaaS"
# Generated: Complete fullstack structure with auth, database, deployment

/auth-setup jwt --features email-verification,2fa
# Added: Enterprise-grade authentication

/env-config-setup --services database,redis,email,payments
# Configured: All environment variables and secrets

# Week 2: Features (Day 3-7)
/component-generator "ProjectCard with title, status, team members, progress bar"
/component-generator "TaskBoard with drag-and-drop columns"
/component-generator "TeamMemberList with roles and permissions"
# Generated: 15+ React components with TypeScript

/express-api-scaffold "Project Management API"
# Generated: RESTful API with CRUD operations

/prisma-schema-gen "SaaS with organizations, projects, tasks, users, permissions"
# Generated: Complete database schema with relationships

# Week 3-4: Polish & Deploy
# Deployment Specialist: Set up CI/CD, monitoring, analytics
# UI/UX Expert: Review and optimize user experience
# Backend Architect: Review scalability and performance
```

**Results:**

- **Timeline:** 4 weeks → MVP launched on time
- **Cost:** $39 (Fullstack Pack) vs. $15,000-$30,000 (contractor)
- **Savings:** $14,961 (99.7% cost reduction)
- **Quality:** Production-ready code with tests, authentication, deployment
- **Outcome:** Successfully launched, acquired first 50 users in month 1

# 45 minutes per component → 15 components built in 3 weeks
```

**Week 7-10: Backend & Integration**

```bash
/express-api-scaffold "Fitness API"
/auth-setup jwt --features email-verification
# 1 hour: Complete API with authentication

# API Builder agent: Design REST endpoints
