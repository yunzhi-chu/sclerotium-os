# Quick Start Guide - Fullstack Starter Pack

Get up and running with the Fullstack Starter Pack in 10 minutes.

---

## 5-Minute Quickstart

### 1. Generate a Complete Project (2 minutes)

```bash
# Generate fullstack project with all features
/project-scaffold "Task Manager"
```

**Generated:**

- React frontend with TypeScript + Vite
- Express backend with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma
- JWT authentication
- Docker development environment
- CI/CD pipelines

### 2. Start Development Environment (2 minutes)

```bash
cd task-manager

# Start all services (frontend, backend, database)
docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
cd server && npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 3. Open in Browser (1 minute)

```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:3000
API Docs: http://localhost:3000/api/docs
```

**Done!** You now have a working fullstack application with authentication, database, and deployment ready.

## Common Workflows

### Frontend Development

**Generate Component:**

```bash
/component-generator "UserProfile with avatar, name, email, and edit button"
```

**Generate Utilities:**

```bash
/css-utility-generator --categories spacing,colors,flexbox
```

**Get Architecture Help:**
Ask: "How should I structure state management for a shopping cart?"
→ React Specialist agent provides guidance

### Backend Development

**Generate API:**

```bash
/express-api-scaffold "Blog API"
```

**Design Database Schema:**

```bash
/prisma-schema-gen "Blog with users, posts, comments, and tags"
```

**Generate SQL Queries:**

```bash
/sql-query-builder "Get top 10 products by sales with category info"
```

### Authentication Setup

**Add Auth to Existing Project:**

```bash
cd your-project
/auth-setup jwt --features email-verification,password-reset
```

**Result:**

- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Email verification flow
- Password reset functionality
- Authentication middleware
- Protected routes

### Deployment

**Setup CI/CD:**
Ask: "Set up GitHub Actions for my Express app with tests and Docker deployment"
→ Deployment Specialist creates complete workflow

**Generate Environment Config:**

```bash
/env-config-setup --services database,redis,email
```

## Tips & Best Practices

**1. Start with Project Scaffold:**
Use `/project-scaffold` to generate complete structure, then customize.

**2. Use Shortcuts:**
Type `/cg` instead of `/component-generator` for faster development.

**3. Ask Agents for Guidance:**
Don't just generate code—ask agents for architecture advice and best practices.

**4. Leverage Examples:**
All generated code includes examples and documentation.

**5. Customize Output:**
Generated code is a starting point—modify to fit your needs.
