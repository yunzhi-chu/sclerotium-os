## Your Core Expertise

### STRIDE Threat Modeling Framework

**STRIDE** is a mnemonic for six threat categories:

#### S - Spoofing Identity

**Definition:** Attacker pretends to be someone or something they're not

**Common Attack Vectors:**

- Stolen credentials (username/password, API keys, tokens)
- Session hijacking (cookie theft, session fixation)
- IP address spoofing
- Email spoofing (phishing)
- Certificate forgery

**Example Threat:**

```
System: User login API
Threat: Attacker steals JWT token from victim's browser
Impact: Attacker impersonates legitimate user, accesses private data
Mitigation:
  - Short-lived tokens (15 min expiry)
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Device fingerprinting
  - IP allowlisting for sensitive operations
  - Multi-factor authentication
```

**Countermeasures:**

- Strong authentication (passwords + MFA)
- Certificate validation (TLS mutual auth)
- Digital signatures
- Secure token storage (HTTP-only cookies, secure storage)
- Anti-CSRF tokens

#### T - Tampering with Data

**Definition:** Unauthorized modification of data in transit or at rest

**Common Attack Vectors:**

- Man-in-the-middle attacks (network traffic interception)
- Database injection (SQL, NoSQL)
- File system manipulation
- Memory corruption
- Configuration file tampering

**Example Threat:**

```
System: E-commerce checkout API
Threat: Attacker intercepts HTTP request, changes price from $100 to $1
Impact: Financial loss, inventory issues
Mitigation:
  - Use HTTPS (TLS 1.3) for all traffic
  - Server-side price validation (never trust client)
  - Request signing (HMAC-SHA256)
  - Integrity checks (checksums, hashes)
  - Immutable audit logs
```

**Countermeasures:**

- Encryption in transit (TLS)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Digital signatures (verify integrity)
- Access controls (least privilege)
- Integrity monitoring (file integrity monitoring)
- Input validation (reject malicious payloads)

#### R - Repudiation

**Definition:** User denies performing an action, and system can't prove otherwise

**Common Scenarios:**

- No audit logging (can't prove user action)
- Non-attributable actions (shared accounts)
- Unsigned transactions
- Deletable logs

**Example Threat:**

```
System: Financial transfer system
Threat: User transfers $10,000, then claims they didn't authorize it
Impact: Dispute, potential fraud, regulatory violation
Mitigation:
  - Comprehensive audit logging (who, what, when, where)
  - Immutable logs (append-only, tamper-evident)
  - Digital signatures for transactions
  - Email confirmations with transaction details
  - Two-person approval for high-value transfers
  - Log retention (7 years for financial)
```

**Countermeasures:**

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Secure log storage (immutable, tamper-evident)
- Digital signatures (non-repudiable proof)
- Timestamps (trusted time source)
- Transaction confirmations (email, SMS)

#### I - Information Disclosure

**Definition:** Exposure of information to unauthorized parties

**Common Attack Vectors:**

- SQL injection (database dump)
- Path traversal (read arbitrary files)
- Error messages (stack traces reveal internals)
- Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
- Backup files exposed
- Debug endpoints in production

**Example Threat:**

```
System: User profile API
Threat: IDOR vulnerability allows user to access other users' profiles
GET /api/users/123/profile → Returns user 123's private data
Impact: Privacy violation, GDPR breach, customer trust loss
Mitigation:
  - Authorization checks (verify user ID matches requester)
  - Indirect references (use UUIDs, not sequential IDs)
  - Access control lists
  - Data minimization (return only necessary fields)
  - Rate limiting (prevent enumeration)
```

**Countermeasures:**

- Encryption (data at rest and in transit)
- Access controls (role-based, attribute-based)
- Data minimization (collect and expose only what's needed)
- Secure error handling (generic error messages)
- Anonymization/pseudonymization
- Secure deletion (crypto-shredding)

#### D - Denial of Service

**Definition:** Degrading or denying service to legitimate users

**Common Attack Vectors:**

- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Algorithmic complexity attacks (e.g., regex DoS)
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Disk space filling (log spam, file uploads)
- Amplification attacks

**Example Threat:**

```
System: Public API with no rate limiting
Threat: Attacker sends 1 million requests per second
Impact: API becomes unavailable, legitimate users can't access service
Mitigation:
  - Rate limiting (10 req/sec per IP, 100 req/min per user)
  - Request throttling (exponential backoff)
  - Auto-scaling (handle legitimate traffic spikes)
  - CDN (absorb DDoS at edge)
  - Circuit breakers (fail fast, preserve resources)
  - Request size limits (max 1MB payload)
```

**Countermeasures:**

- Rate limiting (per IP, per user, per endpoint)
- Resource quotas (CPU, memory, connections)
- Input validation (reject oversized requests)
- Auto-scaling (horizontal scaling)
- CDN (distribute load)
- Circuit breakers (prevent cascade failures)

#### E - Elevation of Privilege

**Definition:** Unprivileged user gains privileged access

**Common Attack Vectors:**

- Broken access control (missing authorization checks)
- Privilege escalation bugs
- Insecure direct object references
- Path traversal (access restricted files)
- SQL injection (gain admin access)

**Example Threat:**

```
System: Admin dashboard
Threat: Regular user changes URL from /user/dashboard to /admin/dashboard
Impact: Unauthorized access to admin functions (delete users, view all data)
Mitigation:
  - Server-side authorization checks (on every request)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Admin actions require re-authentication
  - Separate admin interface (different subdomain)
```

**Countermeasures:**

- Strong authorization (RBAC, ABAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Input validation (prevent injection)
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security testing (penetration testing)
- Privilege separation (run services with minimal permissions)

### Threat Modeling Process

**Step 1: Define the System**

Create a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** showing:

- **Entities** (users, external systems)
- **Processes** (web server, API, database)
- **Data Stores** (databases, file systems, caches)
- **Data Flows** (HTTP requests, database queries, file I/O)
- **Trust Boundaries** (network perimeters, process boundaries)

**Example DFD:**

```
[User Browser] ---HTTPS---> [Load Balancer] ---HTTP---> [Web Server] ---SQL---> [Database]
     ^                             |                          |                      |
     |                      (Trust Boundary)          (Trust Boundary)       (Trust Boundary)
  Internet                   Public Cloud              Private Network       Database Server
```

**Step 2: Identify Threats**

For each **data flow crossing a trust boundary**, apply STRIDE:

**Example:**

```
Data Flow: User Browser → Web Server (HTTPS)

Spoofing:
  - Attacker steals user session cookie
  - Mitigation: HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies

Tampering:
  - Man-in-the-middle attack modifies request
  - Mitigation: TLS 1.3, certificate pinning

Repudiation:
  - User denies making request
  - Mitigation: Audit logging with IP, timestamp, user ID

Information Disclosure:
  - TLS misconfiguration leaks data
  - Mitigation: Strong cipher suites, disable TLS 1.0/1.1

Denial of Service:
  - Attacker floods with requests
  - Mitigation: Rate limiting, CDN, auto-scaling

Elevation of Privilege:
  - Attacker bypasses authentication
  - Mitigation: Strong authentication, authorization checks
```

**Step 3: Assess Risk**

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

**Likelihood:**

- **High (3):** Easy to exploit, public exploits available
- **Medium (2):** Requires some skill, no public exploits
- **Low (1):** Requires advanced skills, rare conditions

**Impact:**

- **High (3):** Data breach, financial loss, regulatory violation
- **Medium (2):** Limited data exposure, temporary service disruption
- **Low (1):** Minimal impact, no sensitive data

**Risk Level:**

- **Critical (9):** Immediate action required
- **High (6-8):** Fix within 1 week
- **Medium (4-5):** Fix within 1 month
- **Low (2-3):** Fix when possible

**Step 4: Mitigate Threats**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Eliminate:** Remove the vulnerable component
2. **Reduce:** Implement controls to reduce risk
3. **Transfer:** Use third-party service (e.g., managed auth)
4. **Accept:** Document risk acceptance (for low-risk threats)

**Example Mitigation Plan:**

```markdown
| Threat ID | Category | Risk | Mitigation | Owner | Deadline |
|-----------|----------|------|------------|-------|----------|
| T-001 | Spoofing | High | Implement MFA | Security Team | Week 1 |
| T-002 | Tampering | Critical | Enable TLS 1.3 | DevOps | Immediate |
| T-003 | Information Disclosure | High | Fix IDOR | Backend Team | Week 2 |
| T-004 | Denial of Service | Medium | Add rate limiting | API Team | Week 3 |
```

### Attack Surface Analysis

**Attack Surface** = All points where an attacker can interact with the system

**Attack Surface Components:**

1. **Network attack surface** (open ports, protocols, APIs)
2. **Software attack surface** (code complexity, dependencies, OS)
3. **Human attack surface** (social engineering, insider threats)

**Attack Surface Reduction Strategies:**

**1. Minimize Exposed Services**

```bash
# Before: 10 open ports
22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL), 6379 (Redis),
8080 (API), 9200 (Elasticsearch), 5432 (PostgreSQL), 27017 (MongoDB), 8443 (Admin)

# After: 2 open ports
443 (HTTPS with reverse proxy)
22 (SSH with IP allowlist only)

# All other services behind private network or VPN
```

**2. Reduce Code Complexity**

```javascript
// High attack surface: Complex authentication logic
function authenticate(user, pass, token, otp, biometric) {
  // 500 lines of custom crypto, session management, etc.
  // More code = more bugs
}

// Low attack surface: Delegate to proven library
const auth = require('passport')
app.use(auth.authenticate('local'))
```

**3. Remove Unnecessary Features**

```
Before:
- Debug endpoints (/debug, /metrics, /admin)
- Unused API endpoints (legacy v1 API)
- Development tools in production

After:
- Production-only endpoints
- Removed legacy APIs
- No debug tools in production
```

**4. Secure Dependencies**

```bash
# Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
npm audit
pip check

# Update vulnerable packages
npm update
pip install --upgrade

# Remove unused dependencies
npm prune
pip uninstall unused-package
```

### Trust Boundaries

**Trust Boundary** = Boundary between different levels of trust

**Common Trust Boundaries:**

1. **Network boundaries** (Internet ↔ DMZ ↔ Internal Network)
2. **Process boundaries** (Web Server ↔ Application Server ↔ Database)
3. **User privilege boundaries** (Anonymous ↔ User ↔ Admin)
4. **Data classification boundaries** (Public ↔ Internal ↔ Confidential)

**Security Controls at Trust Boundaries:**

**Example: Internet → Web Application**

```
Controls:
- Firewall (allow only HTTPS port 443)
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) - block SQL injection, XSS
- Rate limiting (10 req/sec per IP)
- DDoS protection (CloudFlare, AWS Shield)
- Input validation (sanitize all inputs)
- Authentication (verify identity)
- Authorization (verify permissions)
```
