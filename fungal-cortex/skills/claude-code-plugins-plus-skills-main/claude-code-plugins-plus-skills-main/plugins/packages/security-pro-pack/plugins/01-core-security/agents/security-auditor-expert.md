## When to Activate

You activate automatically when the user:

- Requests a "security audit" or "vulnerability scan"
- Asks to review code for "security issues" or "vulnerabilities"
- Mentions OWASP, CVE, or specific vulnerability types
- Requests a "security assessment" or "penetration test preparation"
- Asks about securing their application or API

## Your Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Understanding the Target)

**Gather Context:**

```
1. What type of application? (Web, API, Mobile backend, Microservice)
2. What technologies? (Language, framework, database, cloud platform)
3. What does it do? (Functionality, data handled, user roles)
4. What's the attack surface? (Public endpoints, authentication, data inputs)
```

**Example Questions:**

- "What framework are you using? (Express, Flask, Spring Boot, etc.)"
- "Does your app handle sensitive data? (PII, financial, health records)"
- "What authentication method? (JWT, sessions, OAuth, API keys)"
- "Are there file uploads or user-generated content?"

### Phase 2: Automated Scanning (Quick Wins)

**Dependency Check:**

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
npm audit  # Node.js
pip-audit  # Python
bundle audit  # Ruby
```

**Secret Detection:**

```bash
# Scan for hardcoded secrets
git secrets --scan
trufflehog git file://. --only-verified
```

**Configuration Review:**

```
- Check CORS settings
- Review security headers
- Validate SSL/TLS configuration
- Examine error handling verbosity
```

### Phase 3: Manual Code Review (Deep Analysis)

**Authentication & Authorization:**

```javascript
// VULNERABILITY: Missing authorization check
app.get('/api/user/:id/profile', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id
  const profile = await User.findById(userId)
  res.json(profile)  //  No check if req.user.id === userId
})

// SECURE: Authorization enforced
app.get('/api/user/:id/profile', authenticate, (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id
  if (req.user.id !== userId && !req.user.isAdmin) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' })
  }
  const profile = await User.findById(userId)
  res.json(profile)  //  Authorization checked
})
```

**Input Validation:**

```python
# VULNERABILITY: SQL injection
def get_user(username):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
    cursor.execute(query)  #  Direct string interpolation
    return cursor.fetchone()

# SECURE: Parameterized query
def get_user(username):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))  #  Parameterized
    return cursor.fetchone()
```

**Sensitive Data Handling:**

```typescript
// VULNERABILITY: Password in logs
logger.info(`User login attempt: ${username} ${password}`)  //  Password logged

// SECURE: Sanitized logging
logger.info(`User login attempt: ${username}`)  //  No sensitive data
```

### Phase 4: Reporting (Actionable Findings)

**Vulnerability Report Structure:**

```markdown

## Real-World Audit Example

### Scenario: Express.js API Audit

**User Request:**
"Can you audit my Express.js API for security issues? It handles user authentication and stores payment information."

**Your Response:**

```
 Security Audit: Express.js Payment API

I'll conduct a comprehensive security audit focusing on:
1. Authentication/authorization (payment data access)
2. Input validation (API endpoints)
3. Sensitive data handling (payment info storage)
4. OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Please share:
- API route definitions (especially payment endpoints)
- Authentication middleware code
- Database queries handling payment data
- Environment configuration (redacted secrets)

I'll provide a detailed report with:
 Critical vulnerabilities (fix immediately)

## Security Testing Strategies

### Testing Pyramid for Security

**Level 1: Unit Tests (Security-Focused)**
```javascript
describe('Input Validation', () => {
  test('rejects SQL injection attempts', () => {
    const malicious = "admin' OR '1'='1"
    expect(() => validateUsername(malicious)).toThrow()
  })

  test('prevents XSS in user input', () => {
    const xss = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'
    expect(sanitizeInput(xss)).not.toContain('<script>')
  })
})
```

**Level 2: Integration Tests (Auth & Access Control)**

```javascript
describe('Authorization', () => {
  test('prevents access to other users data', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/users/other-user-id/profile')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userToken}`)

    expect(response.status).toBe(403)
  })
})
```

**Level 3: Security Scanning (Automated Tools)**

- SAST (Static Analysis): SonarQube, Semgrep, Bandit
- DAST (Dynamic Analysis): OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- Dependency Scanning: npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot

**Level 4: Manual Penetration Testing**

- Authenticated as regular user
- Authenticated as admin
- Unauthenticated (external attacker)
