## What Gets Scanned

### 1. Secret Detection (Critical Priority)

**Scans For:**

- API keys and tokens
- Database credentials
- Private keys (RSA, SSH)
- OAuth secrets
- Cloud provider credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- JWT secrets
- Encryption keys

**Example Findings:**

```javascript
//  CRITICAL: Hardcoded AWS credentials
const AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
const AWS_SECRET_KEY = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"

// File: config/aws.js:12-13
// Severity: Critical
// Fix: Move to environment variables or AWS IAM roles
```

### 2. Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Priority)

**Checks:**

- npm packages (Node.js)
- pip packages (Python)
- gem packages (Ruby)
- Maven dependencies (Java)
- NuGet packages (.NET)

**Example Findings:**

```
 Critical Vulnerability in lodash@4.17.15

CVE: CVE-2020-8203
Severity: High (CVSS 7.4)
Vulnerable: lodash < 4.17.19
Fixed in: lodash >= 4.17.19

Vulnerability: Prototype Pollution
Impact: Remote code execution possible via crafted input

Fix: npm install lodash@^4.17.19
```

### 3. Security Misconfigurations (Medium Priority)

**Scans For:**

- Debug mode enabled in production
- Insecure CORS configurations
- Missing security headers
- Weak SSL/TLS settings
- Verbose error messages
- Default credentials
- Exposed admin panels

**Example Findings:**

```javascript
// ️  HIGH: Debug mode enabled
app.set('debug', true)  // Should be false in production

// ️  HIGH: Permissive CORS
app.use(cors({ origin: '*' }))  // Allows all origins

//  MEDIUM: Missing security headers
// Recommendation: Add helmet.js middleware
```

### 4. Common Vulnerability Patterns (Medium Priority)

**Code Pattern Detection:**

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) risks
- Path traversal possibilities
- Command injection risks
- Insecure deserialization
- Weak cryptography usage

**Example Findings:**

```python
# ️  HIGH: SQL Injection risk
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # String interpolation
cursor.execute(query)

# File: api/users.py:45
# Severity: High
# Fix: Use parameterized queries
# cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
```

## Automation & CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Security Scan
        run: |
          /security-scan-quick --output security-report.md

      - name: Upload Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: security-report
          path: security-report.md

      - name: Fail on Critical Issues
        run: |
          if grep -q " Critical" security-report.md; then
            echo "Critical security issues found!"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### GitLab CI Example

```yaml
security_scan:
  stage: test
  script:
    - /security-scan-quick --output security-report.md
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - security-report.md
    expire_in: 30 days
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
```

---

## False Positives & Limitations

### Common False Positives

**1. Test Credentials**

```javascript
// Flagged as hardcoded secret, but it's a test credential
const TEST_API_KEY = "test_key_123"  // Used only in tests
```

**Solution:** Add comment to clarify

```javascript
// SECURITY_SCAN_IGNORE: Test credential, not used in production
const TEST_API_KEY = "test_key_123"
```

**2. Public API Keys**

```javascript
// Flagged, but it's a public key (safe to commit)
const STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "pk_test_123"  // Public key, safe
```

**Solution:** Public keys are safe to commit (they're meant to be public)

### What Quick Scan Can't Detect

**Business Logic Flaws:**

- Race conditions
- Privilege escalation via workflow abuse
- Payment bypass logic
- Complex authorization bugs

**Solution:** Use full security audit (`/security-audit`) for business logic review

**Runtime Vulnerabilities:**

- Memory leaks
- Performance issues
- Runtime injection attacks

**Solution:** Dynamic testing (pen testing) required

---

## Best Practices

### Run Scans Regularly

**Daily:** Quick scan before pushing code

```bash
git add .
/ss  # Quick security check
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

**Weekly:** Full security audit

```bash
/security-audit
```

**Monthly:** External penetration test (for production systems)

### Fix Prioritization

**Order of Operations:**

1. **Critical** (hardcoded secrets) → Fix immediately (< 1 hour)
2. **High** (SQL injection, known CVEs) → Fix within 24 hours
3. **Medium** (misconfigurations) → Fix within 1 week
4. **Low** (best practices) → Backlog

**Don't Get Overwhelmed:**

- Start with critical issues only
- One fix at a time
- Re-scan after each fix to verify
- Celebrate progress!

### Security Culture

**Make Security Easy:**

- Pre-commit hooks (auto-scan before commit)
- CI/CD integration (auto-scan on PR)
- Regular team reviews (weekly security check-ins)
- Security champions (team security advocates)

**Share Findings:**

- Security scan reports in team chat
- Celebrate zero-critical milestone
- Learn from findings (don't blame)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Scan Takes Too Long (>5 Minutes)

**Cause:** Large codebase or many dependencies

**Solution:**

```bash
# Scan specific directories only
/ss src/  # Scan source code only

# Skip dependency check (faster)
/ss --skip-deps

# Exclude large directories
/ss --exclude node_modules,dist,build
```

### False Positives

**Problem:** Scan flags test credentials or public keys

**Solution:**

```javascript
// Add ignore comment
// SECURITY_SCAN_IGNORE: Test credential
const TEST_KEY = "test_123"
```

### No Issues Found (Suspicious?)

**Verify:**

- Scan completed successfully (check for errors)
- Scanned correct directory (`/ss /path/to/project`)
- Dependencies were scanned (`--skip-deps` not used)

**If truly no issues:** Congratulations! Run full audit to confirm.
