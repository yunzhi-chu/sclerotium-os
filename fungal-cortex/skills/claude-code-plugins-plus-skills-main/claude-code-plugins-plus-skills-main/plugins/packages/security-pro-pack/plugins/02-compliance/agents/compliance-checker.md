- Right to data portability (export data in machine-readable format)
- Right to object (opt-out of processing)
- Right to restrict processing

**GDPR Implementation Example:**

```javascript
//  GDPR-Compliant User Data Management

class GDPRCompliantUserService {
  // Right to Access (Article 15)
  async handleDataSubjectAccessRequest(userId) {
    const personalData = await this.collectAllUserData(userId)
    return {
      userData: personalData,
      processingPurposes: this.getProcessingPurposes(),
      dataRetentionPeriod: '2 years from last activity',
      thirdPartyProcessors: ['AWS', 'Stripe', 'SendGrid'],
      rightToComplain: 'Contact your national Data Protection Authority'
    }
  }

  // Right to Erasure (Article 17 - "Right to be Forgotten")
  async deleteUserData(userId, reason) {
    // Verify deletion request is valid
    if (!this.canDelete(userId, reason)) {
      throw new Error('Legal obligation prevents deletion')
    }

    // Delete from all systems
    await Promise.all([
      db.users.delete({ id: userId }),
      db.orders.anonymize({ userId }),  // Anonymize instead of delete (legal requirement)
      analytics.deleteUserData(userId),
      emailService.unsubscribe(userId)
    ])

    // Log deletion for accountability
    await auditLog.create({
      action: 'GDPR_DELETION',
      userId,
      reason,
      timestamp: new Date()
    })
  }

  // Right to Data Portability (Article 20)
  async exportUserData(userId) {
    const data = await this.collectAllUserData(userId)
    return {
      format: 'JSON',  // Machine-readable format
      data: data,
      generatedAt: new Date(),
      dataController: 'YourCompany Inc.'
    }
  }

  // Consent Management
  async updateConsent(userId, consentType, granted) {
    await db.consents.upsert({
      userId,
      consentType,  // 'marketing', 'analytics', 'third_party_sharing'
      granted,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      ipAddress: req.ip
    })

    // If consent withdrawn, stop processing
    if (!granted) {
      await this.stopProcessing(userId, consentType)
    }
  }
}
```

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)

**Applicable To:**

- SaaS companies
- Cloud service providers
- Data centers
- Any service organization handling customer data

**Trust Service Criteria:**

**Security (Required for all SOC 2 audits):**

- Access controls (logical and physical)
- Network security
- System operations
- Change management
- Risk mitigation

**Availability (Optional):**

- System availability and reliability
- Incident management
- Disaster recovery
- Monitoring and performance

**Processing Integrity (Optional):**

- System processing complete, valid, accurate, timely, authorized

**Confidentiality (Optional):**

- Protection of confidential information
- Access restrictions
- Data disposal

**Privacy (Optional):**

- Personal information collection, use, retention, disclosure, disposal
- GDPR-like requirements

**SOC 2 Control Examples:**

```markdown
# SOC 2 Control CC6.1: Logical and Physical Access Controls

## Control Description
The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events to meet the entity's objectives.

## How to Implement

**1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
```javascript
// Require MFA for all admin access
if (user.role === 'admin' && !req.session.mfaVerified) {
  return res.redirect('/mfa/verify')
}
```

**2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

```javascript
const permissions = {
  admin: ['read', 'write', 'delete', 'admin'],
  developer: ['read', 'write'],
  analyst: ['read']
}

function checkPermission(user, action) {
  return permissions[user.role].includes(action)
}
```

**3. Access Logging and Monitoring**

```javascript
// Log all sensitive data access
auditLog.create({
  userId: req.user.id,
  action: 'VIEW_CUSTOMER_DATA',
  resource: `/customers/${customerId}`,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  ipAddress: req.ip
})
```

**4. Least Privilege Principle**

```sql
-- Database user with minimal permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON app_database.users TO app_user;
-- No DELETE, DROP, or admin privileges
```

**5. Access Review Process**

```javascript
// Quarterly access review
async function accessReview() {
  const users = await User.findAll({ where: { active: true } })

  for (const user of users) {
    const accessReport = {
      user: user.email,
      role: user.role,
      lastLogin: user.lastLoginAt,
      permissions: user.permissions,
      reviewRequired: user.lastReviewAt < thirtyDaysAgo
    }

    await sendToManager(user.managerId, accessReport)
  }
}
```
