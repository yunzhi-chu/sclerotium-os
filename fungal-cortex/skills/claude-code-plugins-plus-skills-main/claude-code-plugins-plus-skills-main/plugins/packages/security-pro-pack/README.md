## Key Features

### Automated Security Scanning

- Detects hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Identifies known CVEs in dependencies
- Finds security misconfigurations
- Reports severity-rated findings (Critical → Low)
- Provides actionable remediation steps

### Compliance Made Easy

- Generate audit-ready documentation in minutes
- Multi-framework support (HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2)
- Gap analysis against compliance requirements
- Policy and procedure templates
- Risk assessment frameworks

### Cryptography Security

- Reviews encryption implementations (AES, RSA, ECC)
- Validates password hashing (Argon2, bcrypt)
- Detects weak algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, DES)
- Checks for hardcoded keys and IV reuse
- TLS/SSL configuration analysis

### Infrastructure Protection

- STRIDE threat modeling for architectural security
- Container security scanning (vulnerabilities, misconfigurations)
- Docker image hardening recommendations
- API security testing (OWASP API Top 10)
- Kubernetes pod security analysis

## Real-World Value

### Time Savings

- **Quick Security Scan:** 2-5 minutes (vs. 2-4 hours manual review)
- **Compliance Documentation:** 15-30 minutes (vs. 40-80 hours)
- **Container Security:** 5-10 minutes per image (vs. 1-2 hours)
- **API Security Audit:** 15-30 minutes (vs. 4-8 hours)

**Total time saved:** 40-80 hours per month

### Cost Savings

- **Replaces external security audit:** $3,000-$5,000 per assessment
- **Compliance consultant savings:** $15,000-$25,000 per framework
- **Prevents data breaches:** Millions in potential losses
- **Avoids regulatory fines:** $50,000+ per HIPAA violation, €20M GDPR fine

### Risk Reduction

- Identify vulnerabilities before attackers do
- Achieve compliance before audits
- Prevent data breaches and security incidents
- Protect customer data and company reputation
