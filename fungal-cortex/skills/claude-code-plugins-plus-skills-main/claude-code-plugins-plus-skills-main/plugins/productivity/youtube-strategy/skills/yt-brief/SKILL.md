# YouTube Brief

You are creating a structured production brief for a YouTube video. The brief is the bridge between an idea and a filmable video - it defines what the video IS.

## Before You Start

You need from the user:

1. **The video idea** - Either a validated idea from `/yt-ideate` (with title, tier, type, angle) or a raw idea the user wants to develop
2. **Any constraints** - Timeline, specific features to include/exclude, target length, team capacity

If the user is coming from the ideation flow, load `validated_ideas.json` for the full context on the selected idea.

## The Briefing Process

### Step 1: Research the Topic

Before writing the brief, understand the topic deeply:

- What does this feature/tool actually do? (Use WebSearch if needed)
- What are the common pain points or confusion points?
- What existing content exists? What angle would differentiate this video?
- What's the practical value for the target audience?

### Step 2: Define the Video Identity

Work with the user to lock in:

**Content Type & Tier:**

- Confirm which tier and category this falls under
- This determines the format, length, and production approach

**The Angle:**

- What's the unique take? Why would someone click THIS video over alternatives?
- The angle should be specific and defensible, not generic
- Good: "How to use MCP integrations to automate your marketing reporting without any code"
- Bad: "MCP tutorial"

**Target Audience Segment:**

- Who is the primary viewer?
- What's their starting knowledge level for this topic?

### Step 3: Write the Brief

The brief must include:

1. **Title (working)** - Will be refined in packaging, but needs a clear working title
2. **Content tier & type** - e.g., Tier 1 / Feature Tutorial
3. **The angle** - 1-2 sentences: what makes this video unique
4. **Target audience** - Who exactly is this for, and what do they already know
5. **Key points** - 5-8 main things the viewer will learn or see demonstrated
6. **Value proposition** - After watching, the viewer will be able to [specific outcome]
7. **CTA asset** - What free asset can be given away? (template, skill, workflow, plugin)
8. **Prerequisites** - What does the viewer need to have set up before watching?
9. **Demo requirements** - What tools, accounts, or setups are needed for filming?
10. **Estimated length** - Target duration based on content type
11. **Urgency/timing** - Is this time-sensitive (update video) or evergreen?

### Step 4: Review with User

Present the complete brief and ask:

"Here's the brief for '[title]'. Review it:"

```
[Full brief in clean markdown format]
```

"What would you like to adjust?"

- Approve - move to packaging
- Adjust the angle
- Add/remove key points
- Change the CTA asset
- Change the target audience
- Start over with a different approach

**This is a mandatory human checkpoint. Do NOT proceed without approval.**

### Step 5: Save the Brief

Save the approved brief as `video-brief-yt-brief.md` in the working directory.

## Key Principles

- **The angle is everything.** A brief without a clear, differentiated angle will produce a generic video. Push the user to be specific.
- **Practical value first.** Every key point should contribute to the viewer being able to DO something. No filler sections.
- **CTA integration.** The CTA asset should feel like a natural extension of the video content, not a bolted-on pitch.
- **Honest about scope.** If a topic is too big for one video, say so and suggest splitting it. Don't try to cram a Full Tutorial into a Feature Tutorial.
- **Team-ready.** The brief should contain enough detail that a team member could start demo prep without asking follow-up questions.

## Overview

Refine a YouTube video idea into a structured production brief with angle, key points, value proposition, CTA asset, and audience segment.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Yt Brief environment or API
- Required CLI tools installed and authenticated
- Familiarity with Yt Brief concepts and terminology

## Instructions

1. Assess the current state of the Yt Brief configuration
2. Identify the specific requirements and constraints
3. Apply the recommended patterns from this skill
4. Validate the changes against expected behavior
5. Document the configuration for team reference

## Output

- Configuration files or code changes applied to the project
- Validation report confirming correct implementation
- Summary of changes made and their rationale

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Authentication failure | Invalid or expired credentials | Refresh tokens or re-authenticate with Yt Brief |
| Configuration conflict | Incompatible settings detected | Review and resolve conflicting parameters |
| Resource not found | Referenced resource missing | Verify resource exists and permissions are correct |

## Examples

**Basic usage**: Apply yt brief to a standard project setup with default configuration options.

**Advanced scenario**: Customize yt brief for production environments with multiple constraints and team-specific requirements.
