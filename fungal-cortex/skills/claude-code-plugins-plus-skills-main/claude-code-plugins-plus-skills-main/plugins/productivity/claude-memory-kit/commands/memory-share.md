Sync MEMORY.md to git for team collaboration.

1. Run the share script:

   ```bash
   bash plugins/productivity/claude-memory-kit/skills/memory-kit/scripts/memory-share.sh
   ```

2. If the script succeeds, confirm the branch and timestamp
3. If it fails, report the error and suggest resolution

Teammates can then run `/memory-load` to pick up where you left off.
