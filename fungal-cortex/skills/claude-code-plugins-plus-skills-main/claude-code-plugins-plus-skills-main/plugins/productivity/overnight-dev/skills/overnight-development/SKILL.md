2. Gather required inputs and parameters
3. Execute skill workflow systematically
4. Validate outputs meet requirements
5. Handle errors and edge cases appropriately
6. Provide clear results and next steps

## Output

- Primary deliverables based on skill purpose
- Status indicators and success metrics
- Generated files or configurations
- Reports and summaries as applicable
- Recommendations for follow-up actions

## Error Handling
