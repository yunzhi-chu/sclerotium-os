# Vibe Guide

Non-technical progress summaries for Claude Code work. Hides diffs, logs, and technical noise so you can pair program with AI without being overwhelmed by implementation details.

## What's New in This Package

Vibe Guide introduces a completely new way to interact with Claude Code:

- **Stepwise Execution**: Instead of running everything at once, work happens in small, reviewable steps
- **Plain Language Updates**: No more walls of code diffs - you get friendly summaries of what changed
- **Error Checklists**: When something breaks, you get a numbered list of what to do, not a stack trace
- **Learning Mode**: Optional educational micro-explanations teach concepts as you go
- **Session Persistence**: Progress is saved to `.vibe/` so you can pause and resume anytime
- **Auto-Summarization**: Hook automatically condenses verbose command output

This plugin is perfect for:

- Non-technical founders working with AI to build products
- Designers reviewing code changes
- Product managers pairing on implementations
- Anyone who wants to understand what's happening without reading code

## Progressive Workflow

Vibe Guide uses a **stepwise approach** - each command does ONE thing:

```
/vibe-guide:vibe "Add dark mode"     ← Start session, run step 1
         ↓
/vibe-guide:continue                  ← Run step 2
         ↓
/vibe-guide:continue                  ← Run step 3
         ↓
      ... repeat ...
         ↓
      ✅ Done!
```

This gives you control - review each step before moving on.

Something went wrong, but it's fixable.

What happened: Couldn't connect to the database server.

To fix this:

After you've done that, run /vibe-guide:status to continue.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session.json` | Goal, settings, pause state |
| `status.json` | Current step, progress, errors |
