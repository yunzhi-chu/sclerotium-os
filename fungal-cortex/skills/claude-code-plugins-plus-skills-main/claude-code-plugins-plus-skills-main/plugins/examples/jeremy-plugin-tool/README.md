### Example Workflows

**Workflow 1: Create New Plugin**

```
You: "I need to create a new DevOps plugin called 'docker-optimizer' with commands"

Skills Powerkit automatically:
1. Recognizes "create new plugin" → Invokes Plugin Creator
2. Scaffolds plugins/devops/docker-optimizer/
3. Generates plugin.json, README, LICENSE, commands/
4. Adds to marketplace.extended.json
5. Syncs marketplace.json
6. Validates everything
7. Reports: "✅ Plugin created and ready!"
```

**Workflow 2: Validate Before Commit**

```
You: "Is my owasp-scanner plugin ready to commit?"

Skills Powerkit automatically:
1. Recognizes "ready to commit" → Invokes Plugin Validator
2. Checks plugin.json schema
3. Validates frontmatter
4. Verifies marketplace entry
5. Checks permissions
6. Reports: "✅ PASSED - Ready to commit!"
```

**Workflow 3: Security Audit**

```
You: "Security audit on the new password-manager plugin"

Skills Powerkit automatically:
1. Recognizes "security audit" → Invokes Plugin Auditor
2. Scans for hardcoded secrets
3. Checks dangerous commands
4. Validates security patterns
5. Generates audit report
6. Reports: "⚠️ Found 2 issues - no hardcoded credentials allowed"
```

**Workflow 4: Release Management**

```
You: "Bump docker-optimizer to minor version and update marketplace"

Skills Powerkit automatically:
1. Recognizes "bump to minor" → Invokes Version Bumper
2. Calculates new version (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
3. Updates plugin.json
4. Recognizes "update marketplace" → Invokes Marketplace Manager
5. Updates marketplace.extended.json
6. Syncs marketplace.json
7. Reports: "✅ Version bumped to 1.1.0, marketplace updated"
```

## Integration with Repository Workflow

### Works With Existing Tools

Skills Powerkit **enhances** existing tools:

- Uses `./scripts/validate-all.sh` under the hood
- Calls `npm run sync-marketplace` automatically
- Validates with `jq` and `python3 scripts/check-frontmatter.py`
- Follows same standards as CI/CD

### CI/CD Compatibility

Skills run the **same checks as GitHub Actions**:

- `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml` checks
- Security scans match CI patterns
- Validation matches CI requirements
- **Fix issues before CI fails**

---

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI with Skills support (October 2025+)
- Working in `claude-code-plugins` repository
- Node.js for `npm run sync-marketplace`
- Python 3 for frontmatter validation
- `jq` for JSON validation

---

## Pro Tips

### 💡 Tip 1: Chain Skills

Say: "Create a security plugin, validate it, and add to marketplace"

### 💡 Tip 2: Pre-Commit Check

Say: "Is everything ready to commit?"
→ Validator runs comprehensive check

### 💡 Tip 3: Quality Assurance
