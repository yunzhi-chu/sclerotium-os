## Prerequisites

- Excel or compatible spreadsheet software

- Clear understanding of analysis dimensions and measures

## Instructions

1. Verify source data is in tabular format with headers
2. Create pivot table from data range
3. Configure rows, columns, values, and filters
4. Add calculated fields for custom metrics
5. Insert slicers for interactive filtering
6. Format and style for presentation

## Output

- Calculated fields for derived metrics
- Interactive slicers for filtering
- Dashboard-ready formatting

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
