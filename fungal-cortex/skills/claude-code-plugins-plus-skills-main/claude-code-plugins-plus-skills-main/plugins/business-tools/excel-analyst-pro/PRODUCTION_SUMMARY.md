## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Plugin Matters

1. **Perfect Timing:** Anthropic just announced Claude for Excel (Oct 27, 2025) - massive awareness spike

2. **Market Gap:** No open-source alternative to $30/month Microsoft Copilot for Excel

3. **Security Advantage:** Local processing (no cloud upload) appeals to regulated industries

4. **Developer Market:** Underserved segment (Excel automation for CI/CD, migrations, etc.)

5. **Skills Innovation:** First major Excel plugin using auto-invoked Skills system

### What Makes It Unique

**Not just an MCP wrapper:**

- MCP server = low-level tools (read/write Excel)
- Skills = high-level expertise (financial modeling best practices)
- Together = complete professional solution

**Investment banking grade:**

- Follows actual IB modeling standards
- Professional formatting built-in
- Audit trail and best practices
- Sensitivity analysis included

**Token efficient:**

- Skills load only when relevant (not always)
- 50-70% token reduction vs MCP-only approach
- Faster responses, lower costs
