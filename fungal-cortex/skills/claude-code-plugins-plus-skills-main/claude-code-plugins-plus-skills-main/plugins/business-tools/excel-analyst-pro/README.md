2. Type `AAPL <EQUITY> FA` for financials
3. Export to Excel
4. Build DCF model

**Free Approach (This Plugin):**

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Get Apple data
aapl = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
revenue = aapl.financials.loc["Total Revenue"]
operating_income = aapl.financials.loc["Operating Income"]
market_cap = aapl.info["marketCap"]

# Get risk-free rate from FRED
from fredapi import Fred
fred = Fred(api_key="YOUR_FREE_KEY")
risk_free_rate = fred.get_series_latest_release("DGS10").iloc[-1]

# Now use Excel Analyst Pro to build DCF
# Just say: "Create a DCF model for Apple"
```

**Cost:** $0 (vs $24K/year)

**Step 1:** Get free data from sources above

**Step 2:** Use Excel Analyst Pro to build models

```
You: "Create a DCF model for Tesla"

Claude: What base year revenue should we use for Tesla?

You: "$96.8 billion" (from SEC 10-K or Yahoo Finance, both FREE)

Claude: [Builds complete DCF model]
```

**Step 3:** Save $48K/year by avoiding Bloomberg

### When Free Data Is NOT Enough

**Use paid data if:**

- You're an investment bank pitching M&A ($24K/year justified)
- You need real-time intraday data for trading
- Client requires Bloomberg screenshots for compliance
- You manage $1B+ AUM and need institutional tools

**For everyone else (99% of users):** Free data is sufficient for professional financial models.

### Hybrid Approach

**Best of both worlds:** Use free data 95% of the time, Bloomberg for final client deliverables.

**Cost Reduction:** $48K/year → $2.4K/year (95% savings)

### Resources

- **SEC EDGAR:** [sec.gov/edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar) (FREE)
- **Yahoo Finance:** [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) (FREE)
- **FRED:** fred.stlouisfed.org (FREE API key)
- **Alpha Vantage:** [alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co) (FREE API key)
- **OpenBB:** Install openbb-terminal plugin for unified access

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Start with Defaults

Don't have all assumptions? No problem:

```
You: "Build a DCF but I don't have all the numbers"

Claude: No problem! I can build with industry-average assumptions.
What company are you valuing?

You: Amazon

Claude: I'll use standard assumptions for large-cap tech:
- Revenue growth: 15%, 12%, 10%, 8%, 6%
- EBITDA margin: 25%
- WACC: 9%

You can adjust the "Assumptions" sheet later.
```

### 2. Ask for Explanations

```
You: "Explain the DCF model you built"

Claude: Sure! Let me walk through the DCF model:

📊 What is a DCF?
A DCF values a company based on its future cash flows...

[Detailed explanation provided]
```

### 3. Iterate and Refine

```
You: "The WACC seems high—can we try 8% instead of 10%?"

Claude: Absolutely! Updating WACC from 10% to 8%...

New Enterprise Value: $924B (was $847B)
Change: +$77B (+9.1%)

Lower discount rate increases value as expected.
```

### 4. Request Variations

```
You: "Add a dividend recap in Year 3 to the LBO model"

Claude: I'll add a dividend recapitalization to the model.

In Year 3, after debt paydown:
- Refi to 5.0x EBITDA (from 3.8x)
- Distribute ~$150M to equity sponsors

This boosts IRR by ~300bps with partial liquidity.
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

### What This Plugin Does Well

- Initial valuation analysis ✅
- Pitch decks and presentations ✅
- Academic exercises ✅
- Quick "back of envelope" valuations ✅
- Team standardization ✅

### What Requires Manual Work

- Official fairness opinions ❌
- Detailed IC presentations (need scenario planning) ❌
- Quarterly debt schedules (annual only) ❌
- Complex waterfall structures ❌
- Third-party data validation ❌

**Recommendation:** Use this plugin for initial analysis (80% of use cases), then refine manually for high-stakes decisions.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Local Processing

- ✅ All Excel work happens locally
- ✅ No cloud upload required
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Full control over data

**vs Claude for Excel (cloud-based):**

- ❌ Uploads data to Anthropic cloud
- ❌ Requires Max/Enterprise/Teams subscription
- ❌ Subject to data retention policies

**Recommendation:** For sensitive financial data or regulated industries, use this plugin (local processing) instead of cloud-based solutions.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading

```bash
# Check Claude Code version
claude --version

# Reinstall plugin
/plugin uninstall excel-analyst-pro
/plugin install excel-analyst-pro@claude-code-plugins
```

### MCP Server Not Working

```bash
# Verify Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Manually test MCP server
npx --yes @negokaz/excel-mcp-server
```

### Skill Not Triggering

**Problem:** You said "create DCF" but the Skill didn't load.

**Solution:** Be more explicit:

```
❌ "create DCF"
✅ "Create a DCF model for Apple"
```

Skills trigger on description matching—provide enough context.
