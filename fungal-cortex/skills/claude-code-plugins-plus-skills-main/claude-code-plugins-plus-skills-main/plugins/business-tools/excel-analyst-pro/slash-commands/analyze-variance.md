# Analyze Variance

Automate budget vs actual variance analysis with flagging, commentary, and executive summaries.

## What This Command Does

Creates a comprehensive variance report with:

1. **Variance Summary** - Line-by-line budget vs actual with flags
2. **Executive Summary** - Top variances and key insights
3. **Trend Analysis** - Multi-period variance trends (if applicable)

## Instructions for Claude

When the user types `/analyze-variance`, follow these steps:

### 1. Load Data

Ask for:

- Budget data (Excel file, CSV, or pasted table)
- Actual data (same format as budget)
- Period (month, quarter, YTD)
- Threshold settings (default: ±10% or ±$50K)

### 2. Calculate Variances

For each line item:

- Absolute Variance = Actual - Budget
- Percentage Variance = (Actual - Budget) / Budget × 100%
- Apply sign conventions (revenue unfavorable if below, expenses unfavorable if above)

### 3. Flag Material Items

Apply flagging:

- 🔴 Red: Critical variances (>10% unfavorable or >$100K)
- ⚠️ Yellow: Warning variances (5-10% unfavorable or $50K-$100K)
- ✅ Green: On track (within ±5% or <$50K)

### 4. Generate Commentary

For each flagged item:

- Explain what's driving the variance
- Provide context (is this timing or structural?)
- Recommend actions

### 5. Create Executive Summary

Summarize:

- Bottom-line performance vs budget
- Top 5 unfavorable variances
- Top 5 favorable variances
- Key takeaways and action items
