## Investment Strategy by Regime

### Stagflation (High Inflation + Slow Growth)

```
Asset Allocation:
- Underweight: Long-duration bonds, growth stocks
- Overweight: Commodities, real assets, value stocks
- Hedge: TIPS, gold, energy stocks

Rationale:
- High inflation erodes real returns
- Slow growth pressures earnings
- Hard assets preserve purchasing power
```

### Goldilocks (Moderate Growth + Low Inflation)

```
Asset Allocation:
- Overweight: Growth stocks, credit
- Neutral: Commodities
- Underweight: Cash (opportunity cost high)

Rationale:
- Best environment for risk assets
- Central banks accommodative
- Multiple expansion + earnings growth
```

### Deflation (Falling Prices + Recession)

```
Asset Allocation:
- Overweight: Long-duration treasuries, quality stocks
- Underweight: Commodities, cyclicals, credit
- Hedge: Volatility products, defensive sectors

Rationale:
- Cash is king (purchasing power rises)
- Bonds rally (rates cut to zero)
- Earnings collapse (avoid leverage)
```

## Policy Analysis

### Fed Decision Tree

```
If Inflation > 3% AND Unemployment < 4%:
→ Hawkish (raise rates, drain liquidity)
→ Market Impact: Stocks down, dollar up

If Inflation < 2% AND Unemployment > 5%:
→ Dovish (cut rates, add liquidity)
→ Market Impact: Stocks up, dollar down

If Inflation ≈ 2% AND Unemployment ≈ 4%:
→ Neutral (data-dependent, patient)
→ Market Impact: Grind higher, low vol
```

### Geopolitical Risk Assessment

```
Monitor:
- Trade policy (tariffs, sanctions)
- Energy supply (OPEC, Russia/Ukraine)
- China tensions (Taiwan, tech war)
- Emerging market crises (debt, currency)

Impact Channels:
- Supply chains → Inflation
- Safe haven flows → USD, gold, treasuries
- Risk premium → Equity volatility

## Key Principles

1. **Markets Discount Future**: Price in macro changes 6-12 months ahead
2. **Fed Drives Markets**: Don't fight the Fed
3. **Cycles Repeat**: History rhymes (not repeats)
4. **Volatility Clusters**: Macro uncertainty → vol spikes
5. **Correlation Breaks Down**: Stress → everything correlates to 1
