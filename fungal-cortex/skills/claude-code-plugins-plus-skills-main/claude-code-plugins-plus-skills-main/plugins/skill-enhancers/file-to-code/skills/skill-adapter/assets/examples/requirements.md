# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the [**Project Name Here**] project. This project aims to [**Briefly describe the project's goal**]. This document serves as a single source of truth for all stakeholders and will be used to guide the development process.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

* [**Goal 1: e.g., To increase user engagement by 20%**]
* [**Goal 2: e.g., To reduce customer support tickets related to billing by 15%**]
* [**Goal 3: e.g., To improve the overall user experience by simplifying the onboarding process**]

## 3. User Stories

These are examples of how users will interact with the system.

* As a [**User Role: e.g., Registered User**], I want to be able to [**Action: e.g., reset my password**] so that [**Benefit: e.g., I can regain access to my account if I forget it.**]
* As an [**User Role: e.g., Administrator**], I want to be able to [**Action: e.g., manage user permissions**] so that [**Benefit: e.g., I can control access to sensitive data.**]
* As a [**User Role: e.g., New User**], I want to be able to [**Action: e.g., easily sign up for an account**] so that [**Benefit: e.g., I can quickly access the platform's features.**]
* [**Add more user stories here**]

## 4. Functional Requirements

This section details the specific functions the system must perform.

* **Authentication:**  The system must support user authentication, including login and logout functionality.  [**Specify authentication methods: e.g., username/password, social login (Google, Facebook)**]
* **Data Management:** The system must be able to store, retrieve, update, and delete [**Specify data entities: e.g., user profiles, product information, order details**].
* **Reporting:** The system must generate reports on [**Specify report types: e.g., user activity, sales data, system performance**].
* **API Endpoints:** The system should expose the following API endpoints:
  * `/users`:  [**Description: e.g., Retrieve a list of all users**] - Method: `GET`
  * `/users/{id}`: [**Description: e.g., Retrieve a specific user by ID**] - Method: `GET`
  * `/users`: [**Description: e.g., Create a new user**] - Method: `POST`
  * `/users/{id}`: [**Description: e.g., Update an existing user**] - Method: `PUT`
  * `/users/{id}`: [**Description: e.g., Delete a user**] - Method: `DELETE`
* [**Add more functional requirements here**]

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

This section describes the qualities and constraints of the system.

* **Performance:** The system should respond to user requests within [**Specify timeframe: e.g., 2 seconds**].
* **Security:** The system must protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.  [**Specify security measures: e.g., encryption, access control lists**]
* **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle [**Specify expected load: e.g., 10,000 concurrent users**] without performance degradation.
* **Availability:** The system should be available [**Specify uptime percentage: e.g., 99.9%**] of the time.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-documented and easy to maintain. [**Specify coding standards and documentation requirements**]

## 6. Data Model

[**Describe the database schema, including tables, columns, and relationships. You can use a diagram or a textual description.**]

Example:

* **Users Table:**
  * `id` (INT, Primary Key)
  * `username` (VARCHAR)
  * `email` (VARCHAR)
  * `password` (VARCHAR)
  * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

* **Products Table:**
  * `id` (INT, Primary Key)
  * `name` (VARCHAR)
  * `description` (TEXT)
  * `price` (DECIMAL)
  * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

[**Add more tables and relationships as needed**]

## 7. API Documentation

[**Provide detailed documentation for each API endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and error codes.**]

Example:

**Endpoint:** `/products/{id}`

**Method:** `GET`

**Description:** Retrieve a specific product by ID.

**Request Parameters:**

* `id` (INT, required): The ID of the product to retrieve.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Example Product",
  "description": "This is an example product.",
  "price": 19.99
}
```

**Error Codes:**

* `404`: Product not found.

[**Add documentation for other API endpoints**]

## 8. Deployment

[**Describe the deployment environment and process.  Specify target platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), deployment tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), and deployment steps.**]

## 9. Future Considerations

[**List any features or improvements that are planned for future releases.**]
