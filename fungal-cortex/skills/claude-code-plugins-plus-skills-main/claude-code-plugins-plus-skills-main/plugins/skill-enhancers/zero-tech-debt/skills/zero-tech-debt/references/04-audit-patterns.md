# Audit Patterns — Concrete Things to Grep For

This is the hands-on toolkit for step 2 of the workflow (Audit Reality Against Intent). Each pattern below is a *candidate* for deletion, not an automatic delete. Examine the context, then decide.

## Marker comments

The most reliable signal of intentional debt: someone already flagged it.

```
rg -n "TODO: remove after|DEPRECATED|legacy|temp:|hack:|XXX:|FIXME"
```

Look especially for `// TODO: remove after <date>` where the date is past, and `// temporary` comments that have been there for over a year.

## Versioned identifiers

Functions, files, classes, types, or modules whose name encodes a version or generation:

```
rg -n "_v2|_v3|_new|_old|_legacy|V2$|V3$|Legacy[A-Z]"
fd -e ts -e tsx -e py -e go -e rs "(_v2|_new|_old|_legacy)"
```

These are usually one of three things:

1. A successful migration where the `_old` should be deleted
2. A failed migration where the `_new` should be deleted
3. An in-flight migration — confirm with the owner before touching

## Stale feature flags

Feature flags older than ~6 months that still default to a single branch:

- Check the flag-management system's "default value never changed" view
- Grep for `if (flags.<flagName>)` and check how many code paths each side has
- A flag with a one-line `else` branch (or no `else` at all) is a candidate for inlining

## Pass-through wrappers

Wrappers whose only job is renaming arguments or repackaging return values:

```python
def get_user(user_id):
    return fetch_user(user_id)

def fetch_user(user_id):
    return _user_repo.find(user_id)
```

Three layers, one operation. Collapse to one.

## Delegating route handlers

Route handlers that only delegate to other route handlers (often a legacy URL alias kept "just in case"):

```js
app.get('/api/v1/users', (req, res) => app._router.handle({...req, url: '/api/users'}, res))
```

Either kill the alias or document why it's load-bearing.

## Dual-mode forks

`if (env === 'old' || env === 'legacy')` or `if (clientVersion < N)` branches:

- The "old mode" path is rarely tested
- It accumulates new bugs because nobody exercises it
- Killing it requires confirming all consumers are off the old mode — but the data to confirm is usually accessible

## Duplicate config keys

Config keys with near-identical names that diverged over time:

- `database_url` and `db_url`
- `retry_count` and `max_retries`
- `enabled` and `is_enabled`

Pick one, alias the other for one release, then remove.

## Naming-vs-behavior mismatches

Comments explaining why a name is "actually" different from its behavior:

```js
// note: getUser actually returns a UserProfile, not a User
```

The comment is telling you to rename the function.

## Tests asserting historical bugs

Tests whose assertions describe behavior the operator/user never wanted:

```js
it('returns null when input is empty (legacy behavior)', () => { ... })
```

Either the legacy behavior was correct (then drop the parenthetical) or it wasn't (then the test is wrong, not the candidate refactor).

## Indirection without callers

Abstract classes / interfaces / factories with exactly one implementation. Often introduced "in case we need to swap implementations later" — and we never did. Inline them.

## Configuration-driven chaos

Code shaped like:

```python
HANDLERS = {
    "type_a": handle_a,
    "type_b": handle_b,
    "type_c": handle_c,  # only used by one old code path
}
```

If `type_c` has one caller and no plans to grow, inline it and delete the registry entry.

## What to do with each match

For each candidate:

1. **Find every caller** (workflow step 2)
2. **Decide**: keep / delete / rename
3. **If deleting**: confirm no telemetry references the names you're removing (workflow pre-flight)
4. **Document** in the PR summary as one line: `deleted: <name> — <one-sentence reason>`

A clean audit produces a punch list. The workflow turns that punch list into commits.
