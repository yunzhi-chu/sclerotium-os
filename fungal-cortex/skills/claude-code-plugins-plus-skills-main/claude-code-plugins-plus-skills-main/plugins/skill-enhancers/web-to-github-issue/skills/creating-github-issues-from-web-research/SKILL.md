# Web To Github Issue

Convert web research findings into well-structured GitHub issues with titles, summaries, key recommendations, source links, and appropriate labels.

## Overview

Streamline the research-to-implementation workflow. By integrating web search with GitHub issue creation, Claude can efficiently convert research findings into trackable tasks for development teams.

## How It Works

1. **Web Search**: Claude utilizes its web search capabilities to gather information on the specified topic.
2. **Information Extraction**: The plugin extracts relevant details, key findings, and supporting evidence from the search results.
3. **GitHub Issue Creation**: A new GitHub issue is created with a clear title, a summary of the research, key recommendations, and links to the original sources.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Investigate a technical topic and create an implementation ticket.
- Track security vulnerabilities and generate a security issue with remediation steps.
- Research competitor features and create a feature request ticket.

## Examples

### Example 1: Researching Security Best Practices

User request: "research Docker security best practices and create a ticket in myorg/backend"

The skill will:

1. Search the web for Docker security best practices.
2. Extract key recommendations, security vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.
3. Create a GitHub issue in the specified repository with a summary of the findings, a checklist of best practices, and links to relevant resources.

### Example 2: Investigating API Rate Limiting

User request: "find articles about API rate limiting, create issue with label performance"

The skill will:

1. Search the web for articles and documentation on API rate limiting.
2. Extract different rate limiting techniques, their pros and cons, and implementation examples.
3. Create a GitHub issue with the "performance" label, summarizing the findings and providing links to the source articles.

## Best Practices

- **Specify Repository**: When creating issues for a specific project, explicitly mention the repository name to ensure the issue is created in the correct location.
- **Use Labels**: Add relevant labels to the issue to categorize it appropriately and facilitate issue tracking.
- **Provide Context**: Include sufficient context in your request to guide the web search and ensure the generated issue contains the most relevant information.

## Integration

This skill seamlessly integrates with Claude's web search Skill and requires authentication with a GitHub account. It can be used in conjunction with other skills to further automate development workflows.
