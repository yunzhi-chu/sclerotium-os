description: Hyperflow execution phase. Use when a task file exists in .hyperflow/tasks/ and the work needs building — verbs like build, implement, add, refactor, "wire up", "run the plan", "execute the task". Works batches sequentially with self-review and per-task commits. In Antigravity there is no sub-agent fan-out — the single agent does each batch itself.

# hyperflow-dispatch — execution phase (Antigravity single-agent)

Execute the task file from `hyperflow-scope`. **No sub-agent dispatch and no model tiers in Antigravity** — you do each batch yourself, then self-review before committing. Follow the `hyperflow` doctrine.

## Per batch

1. **Implement** every sub-task in the batch (sequentially; they were planned as small, independent units).
2. **Self-review** the batch diff against the level checklist:
   - **L1** syntax/format/obvious bugs · **L2** spec compliance, naming, edge cases · **L3** cross-file integration + security (secrets, injection, validation).
   - Elevate to L3 when the change touches auth, data, or external input. Fix anything found before committing.
3. **Quality gates** on affected files: run the project's lint, typecheck, and tests. Fix failures (never `--no-verify`).
4. **Commit per sub-task** — one sub-task = one conventional commit (respect commitlint: lowercase subject, allowed scope). Stage only that sub-task's files; never commit files you didn't change.
5. **Update the task file's status block** (tick the sub-task, bump progress) and append any durable learning to `.hyperflow/memory/`.

## After all batches

6. **Final integration self-review** over the cumulative diff — catch cross-batch contradictions, scope leaks, and `any`/type regressions.
7. **End gate** via AskUserQuestion: offer to run `hyperflow-audit` (independent review) and/or `hyperflow-deploy`. Both are binary (no recommended marker). Never auto-push.

## Rules

- A `SECURITY_VIOLATION` halts immediately — no commit, no continue.
- If the working tree is dirty with files you didn't create (concurrent work), never stage them; re-check `git status` before each commit.
- Auto mode completes every sub-task before any summary — no partial "to resume" hand-offs.
