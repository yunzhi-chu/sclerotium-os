description: Reflect on session corrections and update CLAUDE.md (with human review)
allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Bash, Grep, AskUserQuestion
---

## Arguments

- `--dry-run`: Preview all changes without prompting or writing.
- `--scan-history`: Scan ALL past sessions for corrections (useful for first-time setup or cold start).
- `--days N`: Limit history scan to last N days (default: 30). Only used with `--scan-history`.
- `--targets`: Show detected AI assistant config files and exit.
- `--review`: Show learnings with stale/decayed entries for review.
- `--dedupe`: Scan CLAUDE.md for similar entries and propose consolidations.

## Context

- Project CLAUDE.md: @CLAUDE.md
- Global CLAUDE.md: @~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Learnings queue: !`cat ~/.claude/learnings-queue.json 2>/dev/null || echo "[]"`
- Current project: !`pwd`

## Multi-Target Export

Claude-reflect syncs learnings to CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (the emerging cross-tool standard).

**Supported Targets:**

| Target | File Path | Format | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `./CLAUDE.md` | Markdown | Always enabled |
| **AGENTS.md** | `./AGENTS.md` | Markdown | Industry standard (Codex, Cursor, Aider, Jules, Zed, Factory) |

**Detection Logic:**

```bash
# Always enabled
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
./CLAUDE.md (if exists)

# Only if file exists
test -f AGENTS.md && echo "AGENTS.md"
```

**Note on Confidence & Decay:**

- Confidence scores help prioritize learnings during `/reflect` review
- Decay applies to **queue items only** — if a learning sits unprocessed for too long, it's flagged as stale
- Once applied to CLAUDE.md, entries are permanent (edit manually to remove)

## Your Task

### Handle --targets Argument

**If user passed `--targets`:**

Detect and display all AI assistant config files in the current project:

```bash
echo "=== Detected AI Assistant Configs ==="
echo ""
echo "✓ ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (Claude Code - always enabled)"
test -f CLAUDE.md && echo "✓ ./CLAUDE.md (Project)" || echo "✗ ./CLAUDE.md (not found)"
test -f AGENTS.md && echo "✓ AGENTS.md (Codex, Cursor, Aider, Jules, Zed)" || echo "✗ AGENTS.md (not found)"
```

Then display summary:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DETECTED TARGETS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  ✓ ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md    (Claude Code - always enabled)
  ✓ ./CLAUDE.md            (Project)
  ✗ AGENTS.md              (not found)

To enable AGENTS.md (syncs to Codex, Cursor, Aider, Jules, Zed, Factory):
  touch AGENTS.md

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Exit after showing targets (don't process learnings).

### Handle --review Argument

**If user passed `--review`:**

Show learnings with their confidence and decay status:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/learnings-queue.json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.timestamp) | conf:\(.confidence // 0.5) | decay:\(.decay_days // 90)d | \(.message | .[0:60])"'
```

Display table of learnings with decay status:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LEARNINGS REVIEW — Confidence & Decay Status
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

┌────┬──────────┬────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
│ #  │ Conf.    │ Decay  │ Learning                       │

└────┴──────────┴────────┴────────────────────────────────┘

Legend: ✓ High confidence  ⚠ Low confidence/Near decay
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Exit after showing review (don't process learnings).

### Handle --dedupe Argument

**If user passed `--dedupe`:**

Scan existing CLAUDE.md files for similar entries that could be consolidated.

**1. Read both CLAUDE.md files:**

```bash
cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Extract all bullet points:**
Look for lines starting with `-` under section headers.

**3. Analyze for semantic similarity:**
Group entries that:

- Reference the same tool/model/concept
- Give overlapping or redundant advice
- Could be merged without losing information

**4. Present consolidation proposals:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CLAUDE.MD DEDUPLICATION SCAN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Found 2 groups of similar entries:

Group 1 (Global CLAUDE.md):
  Line 45: "- Use gpt-5.1 for complex tasks"
  Line 52: "- Prefer gpt-5.1 for reasoning"
  → Proposed: "- Use gpt-5.1 for complex reasoning tasks"

Group 2 (Project CLAUDE.md):
  Line 12: "- Always use venv"
  Line 28: "- Create virtual environment for Python"
  → Proposed: "- Use venv for Python projects"

No duplicates: 23 entries are unique

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**5. Use AskUserQuestion:**

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Apply deduplication to CLAUDE.md files?",
    "header": "Dedupe",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Apply all consolidations", "description": "Merge 2 groups, remove 4 redundant lines"},
      {"label": "Review each group", "description": "Decide per group"},
      {"label": "Cancel", "description": "Keep files unchanged"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**6. Apply changes:**

- Use Edit tool to replace redundant entries with consolidated versions
- Remove duplicate lines
- Preserve section structure

Exit after deduplication (don't process queue).

### First-Run Detection (Per-Project)

Check if /reflect has been run in THIS project before. Run these commands separately:

**WARNING**: Do NOT combine these into a single compound command with `$(...)`. Claude Code's bash executor mangles subshell syntax. Run each command individually and manually substitute the result.

1. Find the project folder name:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/projects/ | grep -i "$(basename "$(pwd)")"
```

1. Check if initialized (replace PROJECT_FOLDER with result from step 1):

```bash
test -f ~/.claude/projects/PROJECT_FOLDER/.reflect-initialized && echo "initialized" || echo "first-run"
```

**If "first-run" for this project AND user did NOT pass `--scan-history`:**

Use AskUserQuestion to recommend historical scan:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "First time running /reflect in this project. Scan past sessions for learnings?",
    "header": "First run",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Yes, scan history (Recommended)", "description": "Find corrections from past sessions in this project"},
      {"label": "No, just process queue", "description": "Only process learnings captured by hooks"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

If user chooses "Yes, scan history", proceed as if `--scan-history` was passed.

### Step 0: Check Arguments

**If user passed `--dry-run`:**

- Process all learnings with project filtering
- Show proposed changes with line numbers
- Do NOT prompt for actions, do NOT write
- End with: "Dry run complete. Run /reflect without --dry-run to apply."

**If user passed `--scan-history`:**

- FIRST: Load the queue (Step 1) - queued items are NEVER skipped
- THEN: Scan ALL historical sessions for this project (Step 0.5)
- Combine queue items + history scan results into working list
- Proceed to Step 3 (Project-Aware Filtering)

### Step 0.5: Historical Scan (only with --scan-history)

Scan past sessions for corrections missed by hooks. Useful for:

- First-time /reflect installation (cold start)
- Periodic deep review of past learnings

**0.5a. Find ALL session files for this project:**

1. First, list project folders to find the correct path pattern:

   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/projects/ | grep -i "$(basename $(pwd))"
   ```

2. **Handle underscores vs hyphens:** Directory names may use underscores (`darwin_new`) but encoded paths use hyphens (`darwin-new`). If first grep fails, try replacing underscores:

   ```bash
   # If no match, try with hyphens instead of underscores
   ls ~/.claude/projects/ | grep -i "$(basename $(pwd) | tr '_' '-')"
   ```

3. Then list ALL session files in that folder:

   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/projects/[PROJECT_FOLDER]/*.jsonl
   ```

Note: Project paths have `/` replaced with `-`. For `/Users/bob/code/myapp`, look for `-Users-bob-code-myapp`.

**IMPORTANT**: With `--scan-history`, process ALL session files (not just recent ones). This includes:

- Main session files (UUID format like `fa5ae539-d170-4fa8-a8d2-bf50b3ec2861.jsonl`)
- Agent files (`agent-*.jsonl`) - these may contain corrections too
- Apply `--days N` filter by checking file modification times if specified

**0.5b. Extract corrections from session files:**

Session files are JSONL. Use jq to extract user messages, then grep for patterns.

**CRITICAL**: Filter out command expansion messages using `isMeta != true`. Command expansions (like /reflect itself) are stored with `isMeta: true` and contain documentation text that would cause false positives.

**DYNAMIC PATTERN SELECTION**: Before running grep, sample a few user messages to detect the conversation language. If non-English, adapt the patterns accordingly:

| Language | Example patterns to add |
|----------|------------------------|
| Russian | `нет,? используй\|не используй\|на самом деле\|запомни:\|лучше\|предпочитаю` |
| Spanish | `no,? usa\|no uses\|en realidad\|recuerda:\|prefiero\|siempre usa` |
| German | `nein,? verwende\|nicht verwenden\|eigentlich\|merke:\|bevorzuge\|immer` |

Generate appropriate patterns for the detected language and combine with English patterns.

**Default English patterns:** `remember:`, `no, use`, `don't use`, `actually`, `stop using`, `never use`, `that's wrong`, `I meant`, `use X not Y`

For each `.jsonl` file in the project folder, extract user messages that match correction patterns. Use your judgment on the best extraction method - you can use Read, Grep, Bash with jq, or any combination that works.

**What to extract:**

1. **User messages** with correction patterns (from `type: "user"` entries with `isMeta != true`)
2. **Tool rejections** - look for `toolUseResult` fields containing "user said:" followed by feedback text
   - "user said:" followed by empty content means rejection without feedback - skip these

**Key file structure:**

- Session files: `~/.claude/projects/[PROJECT_FOLDER]/*.jsonl`
- User messages: `{"type": "user", "message": {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "..."}]}}`
- Tool rejections: `{"toolUseResult": "The user doesn't want to proceed\nuser said:\n[feedback]"}`

**0.5b-extra. Tool rejections are HIGH confidence:**

When a user stops a tool and provides feedback, this is a strong correction signal. The feedback appears after "user said:" (may be on the next line in the JSON).

**CRITICAL: Tool rejections MUST be shown to user:**

- Even if you think they're "task-specific", present them
- The user will decide if they're reusable
- Count how many you found and report: "Found N tool rejections"
- Never say "analyzed N rejections, none reusable" without showing them

**0.5c. Apply date filter if `--days N` specified:**

- Check file modification time
- Skip files older than N days

**0.5d. LLM Filter (Inline):**

For each extracted correction, evaluate whether it's a REUSABLE learning.

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **NEVER filter out `remember:` items** - these are explicit user requests, always present them
2. **NEVER filter out queue items** - the user explicitly captured these via hooks
3. **When in doubt, INCLUDE the learning and let user decide** - don't auto-reject borderline cases
4. **If extraction found matches, SHOW THEM** - never conclude "0 learnings" without presenting raw matches to user
5. **Tool rejections = ALWAYS SHOW** - even "task-specific" ones might have reusable elements

**REJECT ONLY if clearly:**

- A question (ends with "?")
- Pure task confirmation ("yes", "ok", "done", "looks good")
- Too vague to extract meaning ("fix it", "wrong")

**ACCEPT if it mentions:**

- Tool/technology/API names or parameters
- Flags, settings, or configuration options ("enable X", "use flag Y")
- Best practices or patterns ("always do X", "don't do Y")
- Model names or versions
- Rate limits, delays, or timing
- File paths or environment setup

**TRUST USER CORRECTIONS**: For model names, API versions, tool availability, and flag/parameter values - the user has more current knowledge than Claude's training data. Do NOT try to validate whether something "exists" or is "correct". Accept user corrections as authoritative.

**BORDERLINE → Get context first:**
If a correction seems context-specific (like "please enable that flag"), search for surrounding messages to understand WHAT flag/parameter. Often these ARE reusable learnings about API parameters.

```bash
# Get context around a correction (find line number, then show surrounding)
grep -n "enable that flag" "$SESSION_FILE" | head -1
```

For each ACCEPTED correction, create:

1. An actionable learning in imperative form (e.g., "Use gpt-5.1 for reasoning tasks" or "Enable flag X for better results")
2. Suggested scope: "global" or "project"
3. Include the actual parameter/value when possible

**0.5e. Deduplicate:**

- Collect all accepted corrections
- Remove exact duplicates
- For similar corrections, keep the most recent

**0.5f. Build working list:**

- ADD history scan results to working list (alongside any queue items from Step 1)
- Use the actionable learning you created as the proposed entry
- Use the scope suggestion (global/project) as default
- Mark source as "history-scan" or "tool-rejection"

**SANITY CHECK before proceeding:**

- Verify queue items from Step 1 are still in working list
- If queue had N items, working list must have at least N items
- If working list is empty but queue was NOT empty → BUG, re-add queue items

**MANDATORY PRESENTATION RULE:**
If your extraction (grep, search, jq) found ANY matches:

1. You MUST present them to the user - do NOT auto-conclude "0 learnings"
2. Show at least the top 10-15 raw matches for user review
3. For each match, propose: keep as learning OR skip
4. Let the USER decide what's reusable, not the LLM

**Format for presenting raw matches:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RAW MATCHES FOUND — [N] items need review
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

#1 [source: session-scan | tool-rejection]
   "[raw text from extraction]"
   → Proposed: [actionable learning] | Scope: [global/project]

#2 ...
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Then use AskUserQuestion to let user select which to keep.

**NEVER conclude "0 learnings found" if:**

- Grep/search returned >0 matches
- Tool rejections were found but not shown
- You filtered items without user review

- Continue to Step 3 (Project-Aware Filtering) with COMBINED list (queue + history)

### Step 1: Load and Validate

- Read the queue from `~/.claude/learnings-queue.json`
- Add all queue items to the working list (mark source as "queued")
- **IMPORTANT**: Even if queue is empty, continue if `--scan-history` will add items
- Only exit early if: queue is empty AND not doing history scan AND user declines manual capture

### Step 2: Session Reflection (Enhanced with History Analysis)

**Note**: This step is for analyzing the CURRENT session only (when NOT using `--scan-history`).
If `--scan-history` was passed, skip to Step 3 with results from Step 0.5.

Analyze the current session for corrections missed by real-time hooks:

**2a. Find current session file:**

List session files for this project (most recent first):

```bash
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/ | grep -i "$(basename $(pwd))"
```

Then list files in that folder and pick the most recent non-agent file:

```bash
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/[PROJECT_FOLDER]/*.jsonl | head -5
```

Agent files (`agent-*.jsonl`) are sub-conversations; focus on main session files for current session analysis.

**2b. Extract tool rejections (HIGH confidence corrections):**

Search the current session file for `toolUseResult` fields containing "user said:" followed by feedback. These are high-confidence corrections.

- "user said:" followed by empty content = rejection without feedback, skip these
- Extract the feedback text after "user said:" for processing

**2c. Extract user messages with correction patterns:**

Search the current session file for user messages matching correction patterns. Use the same patterns from Step 0.5b. Remember:

- Filter out `isMeta: true` entries (command expansions like /reflect itself)
- Apply language-specific patterns if conversation is non-English

**2d. Also reflect on conversation context:**

- Were there any corrections or patterns not explicitly queued?
- Model names, API patterns, tool usage mistakes, project conventions?
- Implicit corrections (e.g., "Actually, the API returns...")

**2e. LLM Filter (Inline):**
If there are extracted corrections from 2b or 2c, evaluate each using the same criteria as Step 0.5d:

- REJECT questions, one-time tasks, context-specific items, vague feedback
- ACCEPT tool recommendations, patterns, conventions, model corrections
- Create actionable learnings in imperative form with scope suggestions

**2f. Add findings to working list:**
For each ACCEPTED learning:

- Use the actionable learning you created as the proposed entry
- Use the scope suggestion (global/project) as default
- Add to working list alongside queued items
- Mark source type:
  - "queued" — from hooks/explicit remember:
  - "session-scan" — from message pattern matching
  - "tool-rejection" — from tool rejections (HIGH confidence)

### Step 3: Project-Aware Filtering

Get current project path. For each queue item, compare `item.project` with current project:

**CASE A: Same project**

- Show normally
- Offer: [a]pprove | [e]dit | [s]kip
- If approve, ask scope: [p]roject | [g]lobal | [b]oth

**CASE B: Different project, looks GLOBAL**
(message contains: gpt-*, claude-*, model names, general patterns like "always/never")

- Show with warning: "⚠️ FROM DIFFERENT PROJECT"
- Show: "Captured in: [original-project]"
- Offer: [g]lobal | [s]kip (NOT project - wrong context)

**CASE C: Different project, looks PROJECT-SPECIFIC**
(message contains: specific DB names, file paths, project-specific tools)

- Auto-skip with note: "Skipping project-specific learning from [other-project]"
- Offer: [f]orce to add to global anyway

**Heuristics:**

- `gpt-[0-9]` or `claude-` → GLOBAL (model name)
- `always|never|don't` + generic verb → GLOBAL (general rule)
- Specific tool/DB/service names → PROJECT-SPECIFIC
- File paths → PROJECT-SPECIFIC

### Step 3.5: Semantic Deduplication (Within Queue)

Before checking against CLAUDE.md, consolidate similar learnings within the current batch.

**3.5a. Group by semantic similarity:**

Analyze all learnings in the working list. Look for entries that:

- Reference the same tool, model, or concept
- Give similar advice (even with different wording)
- Could be consolidated into a single, clearer entry

**Example - Before consolidation:**

```
1. "Use gpt-5.1 for complex tasks"
2. "Prefer gpt-5.1 over gpt-5 for reasoning"
3. "gpt-5.1 is better for hard problems"
```

**Example - After consolidation:**

```
1. "Use gpt-5.1 for complex reasoning (replaces gpt-5)"
```

**3.5b. Present consolidation proposals:**

If similar learnings are detected, show:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SIMILAR LEARNINGS DETECTED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These 3 learnings appear related:
  #2: "Use gpt-5.1 for complex tasks"
  #5: "Prefer gpt-5.1 over gpt-5 for reasoning"
  #7: "gpt-5.1 is better for hard problems"

Proposed consolidation:
  → "Use gpt-5.1 for complex reasoning tasks (replaces gpt-5)"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**3.5c. Use AskUserQuestion for consolidation:**

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Consolidate these 3 similar learnings into one?",
    "header": "Dedupe",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Yes, consolidate", "description": "Merge into: 'Use gpt-5.1 for complex reasoning tasks'"},
      {"label": "Keep separate", "description": "Add all 3 as individual entries"},
      {"label": "Edit consolidation", "description": "Let me modify the merged text"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**3.5d. Consolidation rules:**

- Keep highest confidence score from the group
- Combine decay_days (use longest)
- Mark source as "consolidated"
- If user chooses "Edit", allow them to provide custom text

**3.5e. Skip if no duplicates:**

- If all learnings are semantically distinct, proceed to Step 4
- Only show consolidation UI when similar entries are detected

### Step 4: Duplicate Detection with Line Numbers

For each learning kept after filtering, search BOTH CLAUDE.md files:

```bash
grep -n -i "keyword" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
grep -n -i "keyword" CLAUDE.md
```

If duplicate found:

- Show: "⚠️ SIMILAR in [global/project] CLAUDE.md: Line [N]: [content]"
- Offer: [m]erge | [r]eplace | [a]dd anyway | [s]kip

### Step 5: Present Summary and Get User Decision

**5a. Display condensed summary table:**

Show all learnings in a compact table format:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LEARNINGS SUMMARY — [N] items found
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

┌────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────┬────────┐
│ #  │ Learning                                │ Scope    │ Status │
├────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────┼────────┤
│ 1  │ Use DB for persistent storage           │ project  │ ✓ new  │
│ 2  │ Backoff on actual errors only           │ global   │ ✓ new  │
│ ...│ ...                                     │ ...      │ ...    │
└────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────┴────────┘

Destinations: [N] → Global, [M] → Project
Duplicates: [K] items will be merged with existing entries
```

**5b. Use AskUserQuestion for strategy:**

Use the AskUserQuestion tool:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "How would you like to process these [N] learnings?",
    "header": "Action",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Apply all (Recommended)", "description": "Add [X] new entries, merge [K] duplicates with recommended scopes"},
      {"label": "Select which to apply", "description": "Choose specific learnings from grouped lists"},
      {"label": "Review details first", "description": "Show full details for each learning before deciding"},
      {"label": "Skip all", "description": "Don't apply any learnings, clear the queue"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**5c. Handle user selection:**

- **"Apply all"** → Proceed to Step 6 (Final Confirmation)
- **"Select which to apply"** → Go to Step 5.1 (Selection Mode)
- **"Review details first"** → Show full learning cards (format below), then return to 5b
- **"Skip all"** → Go to Step 8 (Clear Queue)

**Full learning card format (for "Review details first"):**

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LEARNING [N] of [TOTAL] — [source: queued/session-scan/tool-rejection]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Original message:
  "[the user's original text]"

Proposed addition:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ## [Section Name]                                        │
│ - [Exact bullet point that will be added]                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Duplicate check:
  ✓ None found
  OR
  ⚠️ SIMILAR in [global/project] CLAUDE.md:
     Line [N]: "[existing content]"
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 5.1: Selection Mode (if user chose "Select which to apply")

Group learnings by destination and use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect.

**Rules:**

- Split into multiple questions if >4 items per destination
- Use short labels: "#{N} {short_title}" (max 20 chars)
- Use descriptions for full learning text (max 80 chars)

**Example for GLOBAL learnings:**

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Select GLOBAL learnings to apply:",
      "header": "Global",
      "multiSelect": true,
      "options": [
        {"label": "#2 Backoff errors", "description": "Implement backoff only on actual errors, not artificial delays"},
        {"label": "#3 DB cache", "description": "Use local database cache to minimize data fetching"},
        {"label": "#4 Batch+delays", "description": "Use batching with stochastic delays for API rate limits"},
        {"label": "#5 Use venv", "description": "Always use virtual environments for Python projects"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**If >4 global items:** Add second question with header "Global+"

**Example for PROJECT learnings:**

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Select PROJECT learnings to apply:",
      "header": "Project",
      "multiSelect": true,
      "options": [
        {"label": "#1 DB storage", "description": "Use database for persistent tracking data"},
        {"label": "#6 DB ports", "description": "Assign unique ports per database instance"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Selection rules:**

- Items NOT selected will be skipped
- Continue to Step 6 with selected items only

### Step 6: Final Confirmation

**6a. Show summary of changes:**

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SUMMARY: [N] changes ready to apply
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Project CLAUDE.md ([path]):
  Line [N]: UPDATE "[old]" → "[new]"
  After line [N]: ADD "[new entry]"

Global CLAUDE.md (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md):
  Line [N]: REPLACE "[old]" → "[new]"
  After line [N]: ADD "[new entry]"

Skipped: [N] learnings (including [M] from other projects)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**6b. Use AskUserQuestion for confirmation:**

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Apply [N] learnings to CLAUDE.md files?",
    "header": "Confirm",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Yes, apply all", "description": "[X] to Global, [Y] to Project CLAUDE.md"},
      {"label": "Go back", "description": "Return to selection to adjust"},
      {"label": "Cancel", "description": "Don't apply anything, keep queue"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**6c. Handle response:**

- **"Yes, apply all"** → Proceed to Step 7
- **"Go back"** → Return to Step 5b
- **"Cancel"** → Exit without changes (keep queue intact)

### Step 7: Apply Changes

Only after final confirmation:

**7a. Apply to CLAUDE.md (Primary Targets):**

1. Read current CLAUDE.md files
2. Use Edit tool with precise old_string from detected line numbers
3. For new entries, add after the relevant section header

**7b. Apply to AGENTS.md (if exists):**

Check if AGENTS.md exists:

```bash
test -f AGENTS.md && echo "AGENTS.md found"
```

If AGENTS.md exists, apply the SAME learnings using this format:

```markdown
## Claude-Reflect Learnings

<!-- Auto-generated by claude-reflect. Do not edit this section manually. -->

### Model Preferences
- Use gpt-5.1 for reasoning tasks

### Tool Usage
- Use local database cache to minimize API calls

<!-- End claude-reflect section -->
```

**Update Strategy:**

- Look for existing `<!-- Auto-generated by claude-reflect` marker
- If found: REPLACE the entire section (from marker to `<!-- End claude-reflect section -->`)
- If not found: APPEND section at the end of the file
- Always preserve user's existing content outside the marked section

### Step 8: Clear Queue

```bash
echo "[]" > ~/.claude/learnings-queue.json
```

### Step 9: Confirm

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DONE: Applied [N] learnings
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md    [N] entries
  ✓ ./CLAUDE.md            [N] entries
  ✓ AGENTS.md              [N] entries (if exists)

  Skipped: [N]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 10: Mark Initialized (Per-Project)

Create marker file for THIS project so first-run detection won't trigger again.
Use the PROJECT_FOLDER you found in First-Run Detection:

```bash
touch ~/.claude/projects/PROJECT_FOLDER/.reflect-initialized
```

Replace PROJECT_FOLDER with the actual folder name (e.g., `-Users-bob-myproject`).

## Formatting Rules

- **Bullets, not prose**: Keep entries as single bullet points
- **Actionable**: "Use X for Y" not "X is better than Y"
- **Concise**: Max 2 lines per entry
- **Examples when helpful**: `(e.g., gpt-5.2 not gpt-5.1)`

## Section Headers

Use these standard headers:

- `## LLM Model Recommendations` — model names, versions
- `## Tool Usage` — MCP, APIs, which tool for what
- `## Project Conventions` — coding style, patterns
- `## Common Errors to Avoid` — gotchas, mistakes
- `## Environment Setup` — venv, configs, paths

## Size Check

If CLAUDE.md exceeds 150 lines, warn:

```
Note: CLAUDE.md is [N] lines. Consider consolidating entries.
```
