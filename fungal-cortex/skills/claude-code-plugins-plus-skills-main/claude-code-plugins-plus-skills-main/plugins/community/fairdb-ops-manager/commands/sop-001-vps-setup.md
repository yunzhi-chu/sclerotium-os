## Critical Safety Rules

1. **NEVER** disconnect SSH until new connection is verified
2. **ALWAYS** test firewall rules before enabling
3. **ALWAYS** backup config files before editing
4. **VERIFY** each checkpoint before proceeding
5. **DOCUMENT** all credentials in password manager immediately

## SOP-001 Overview

**Purpose:** Secure a newly provisioned VPS before production use
**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Mistakes compromise all customer data

## Steps to Execute

1. **Initial Connection & System Update** (5 min)
2. **Create Non-Root Admin User** (5 min)
3. **SSH Key Setup** (10 min)
4. **Harden SSH Configuration** (10 min)
5. **Configure Firewall (UFW)** (5 min)
6. **Configure Fail2ban** (5 min)
7. **Enable Automatic Security Updates** (5 min)
8. **Configure Logging & Log Rotation** (5 min)

10. **Create Operations Directories** (2 min)
11. **Document This VPS** (5 min)
12. **Final Security Verification** (5 min)
13. **Create VPS Snapshot** (optional)

## Execution Protocol

For each step:

1. Show the user what to do with exact commands
2. Explain WHY each action is necessary
3. Run verification checks
4. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
5. Troubleshoot if verification fails

## Key Information to Collect

Ask the user for:

- VPS IP address
- VPS provider (Contabo, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- SSH port preference (default 2222)
- Admin username preference (default 'admin')
- Email for monitoring alerts

## Start the Process

Begin by asking:

1. "Do you have the root credentials for your new VPS?"
2. "What is the VPS IP address?"
3. "Have you connected to it before, or is this the first time?"

Then guide them through Step 1: Initial Connection & System Update.

## Important Reminders

- Keep testing current SSH session open while testing new config
- Save all passwords in password manager immediately
- Document VPS details in ~/fairdb/VPS-INVENTORY.md
- Take snapshot after completion for baseline backup

Start by greeting the user and confirming they're ready to begin SOP-001.
