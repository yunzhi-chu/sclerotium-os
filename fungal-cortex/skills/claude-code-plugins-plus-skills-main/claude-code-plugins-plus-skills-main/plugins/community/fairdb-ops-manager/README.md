## Installation

### From Your Private Repository

Since this is your personal plugin:

```bash
# Clone the repository locally if not already
git clone https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins.git
cd claude-code-plugins

# Install the plugin directly from the local path
/plugin install ./plugins/community/fairdb-ops-manager
```

Or add as local marketplace:

```bash
# Create symbolic link to your plugin
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-code-plugins

# Install the plugin
/plugin install fairdb-ops-manager@claude-code-plugins
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. First Time Setup (New VPS)

Use the complete setup wizard for automated guidance:

```bash
# Launch the setup wizard agent
/agent fairdb-setup-wizard
```

The wizard will guide you through:

1. VPS hardening (SOP-001)
2. PostgreSQL installation (SOP-002)
3. Backup configuration (SOP-003)

**Total time:** 3-4 hours

### 2. Manual Step-by-Step Setup

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Step 1: Harden your VPS
/sop-001-vps-setup

# Step 2: Install PostgreSQL
/sop-002-postgres-install

# Step 3: Configure backups
/sop-003-backup-setup
```

### 3. Deploy Helper Scripts to VPS

Once your VPS is set up, deploy the monitoring scripts:

```bash
# SSH to your VPS
ssh admin@your-vps-ip -p 2222

# Create scripts directory (if not exists)
sudo mkdir -p /opt/fairdb/scripts

# Copy scripts from plugin directory
# (Transfer via scp, rsync, or copy-paste)

# Make scripts executable
sudo chmod +x /opt/fairdb/scripts/*.sh

# Schedule health checks
crontab -e
# Add: */5 * * * * /opt/fairdb/scripts/pg-health-check.sh
```

---

## Daily Operations

### Morning Health Check

```bash
# Run guided health check
/daily-health-check

# Or on VPS directly:
ssh your-vps
/opt/fairdb/scripts/pg-health-check.sh
```

### Check Backup Status

```bash
# On VPS:
/opt/fairdb/scripts/backup-status.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ Backup repository accessible
# ✅ Last backup: 8 hours ago
# ✅ No recent errors
```

### Verify SOP Compliance

```bash
# Interactive checklist
ssh your-vps
/opt/fairdb/scripts/sop-checklist.sh

# Select:
# 4) ALL: Complete System Verification
```

---

## Incident Response

### P0: Database Down

```bash
# Launch incident responder
/incident-p0-database-down

# Or use autonomous agent
/agent fairdb-incident-responder
```

The responder will:

1. Classify severity
2. Run systematic diagnostics
3. Execute recovery procedures
4. Verify restoration
5. Generate incident report

### P0: Disk Space Emergency

```bash
/incident-p0-disk-full
```

Provides:

- Rapid space recovery procedures
- Safe cleanup strategies
- Long-term solutions

## Best Practices

### Security

✅ **DO:**

- Always use SSH key authentication
- Disable root login and password authentication
- Enable automatic security updates
- Use SSL/TLS for PostgreSQL connections
- Encrypt backups (AES-256)
- Run regular security audits

❌ **DON'T:**

- Skip backup restoration testing
- Run as root user
- Store passwords in plain text
- Allow remote root access
- Disable firewall or Fail2ban

### Backups

✅ **DO:**

- Test backup restoration regularly (weekly)
- Keep encryption passwords secure but accessible
- Monitor backup age (<48 hours)
- Verify automated backups are running
- Document backup procedures

❌ **DON'T:**

- Trust backups without testing restoration
- Delete only backup copies
- Skip weekly verification
- Ignore backup failure alerts

### Operations

✅ **DO:**

- Run daily health checks
- Document all changes
- Keep operations logs
- Update VPS inventory
- Review metrics regularly

❌ **DON'T:**

- Make undocumented changes
- Skip verification steps
- Ignore warning alerts
- Defer maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Installation Issues

**Problem:** Plugin not found after installation

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify installation
/plugin list | grep fairdb

# Reinstall if needed
/plugin uninstall fairdb-ops-manager
/plugin install ./plugins/community/fairdb-ops-manager
```

### SSH Connection Issues

**Problem:** Can't connect after hardening

**Solution:**

1. Use VNC console from provider (Contabo, etc.)
2. Revert SSH config: `sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
3. Restart SSH: `sudo systemctl restart sshd`
4. Verify settings before trying again

### PostgreSQL Won't Start

**Problem:** Service fails after configuration changes

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check logs
sudo tail -100 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-16-main.log

# Test config syntax
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/postgres --check -D /var/lib/postgresql/16/main

# Restore backup config if needed
sudo cp /etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf.backup /etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

### Backup Failures

**Problem:** pgBackRest cannot connect to Wasabi

**Solution:**

```bash
# Test internet connectivity
curl -I https://s3.wasabisys.com

# Verify credentials in /etc/pgbackrest.conf
sudo vim /etc/pgbackrest.conf

# Check pgBackRest logs
sudo tail -100 /var/log/pgbackrest/main-backup.log

# Test connection
sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=main check
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to know PostgreSQL to use this?

**A:** No! The SOPs are designed for beginners. Each command is explained with WHY, not just HOW. The setup wizard provides hand-holding throughout the process.

### Q: How long does initial setup take?

**A:** 3-4 hours for complete setup (VPS hardening + PostgreSQL + Backups). You can take breaks between phases.

### Q: Can I use this for production?

**A:** Yes! This plugin is based on production best practices for managed PostgreSQL services. However, always test in a staging environment first.

### Q: What if something goes wrong during setup?

**A:** Each SOP has verification checkpoints. If something fails, restore from VPS snapshot and start fresh. The scripts include safety checks to prevent destructive actions.

### Q: Do I need Wasabi, or can I use AWS S3?

**A:** The SOPs use Wasabi (cheaper than AWS S3), but pgBackRest works with any S3-compatible storage. You can modify the configuration for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, etc.

### Q: How much does this cost to run?

**A:** Example costs:

- Contabo VPS (8GB RAM, 200GB NVMe): ~$12/month
- Wasabi storage (first 1TB free, then $6.99/TB/month)
- **Total:** ~$12-20/month for single VPS

### Q: Can this manage multiple VPS instances?

**A:** Yes! Use the commands and agents for each VPS separately. The ops auditor can check compliance across your fleet.

### Q: Is this suitable for enterprise use?

**A:** This plugin is designed for small-to-medium operations (1-20 VPS instances). For enterprise scale, consider additional monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) and orchestration (Ansible, Terraform).
