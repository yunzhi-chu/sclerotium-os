# Generate Project Map Command

You are generating a comprehensive `.claude/project-map.md` file for this codebase.

## Your Task

Analyze the entire codebase and create a clear, concise project map that a new developer can read in a few minutes to understand the system.

## Workflow

1. **Scan the codebase structure**
   - List all top-level directories
   - Identify the main technology stack
   - Find configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, docker-compose.yml, etc.)

2. **Identify the tech stack**
   - Backend framework and language
   - Frontend framework (if any)
   - Database(s)
   - Infrastructure (Docker, K8s, cloud services)
   - Key libraries and dependencies

3. **Map the project structure**
   - Main folders and their responsibilities
   - Entry points and important files
   - Configuration locations

4. **Document the API surface** (if applicable)
   - Main endpoints grouped by domain
   - Authentication method
   - Link to OpenAPI/Swagger if available

5. **Document the database** (if applicable)
   - Main entities and relationships
   - Migration tool and location

6. **Document the frontend** (if applicable)
   - Main pages/routes
   - Component organization
   - State management approach

7. **Document infrastructure**
   - How to run the project locally
   - Docker services and ports
   - Environment variables needed

8. **Document testing**
   - Test frameworks in use
   - How to run tests

## Output Format

Create/overwrite `.claude/project-map.md` with this structure:

```markdown

## Guidelines

- Keep it concise - aim for a document readable in 5 minutes
- Use bullet points and tables
- Link to detailed docs rather than copying content
- Remove any sections that don't apply
- Be accurate - verify information from actual files

## After Generation

Report to the user:
- Summary of what was documented
- Any areas that need manual review
- Suggestions for missing documentation
