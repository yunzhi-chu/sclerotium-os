# Spec Writing

## Overview

Spec Writing provides guidance on authoring effective `specs.md` files that drive the Sprint plugin's autonomous development workflow. A well-written specification determines the quality of agent output by clearly defining goals, scope boundaries, and testing requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Sprint plugin installed (`/plugin install sprint`)
- Project onboarding completed via `/sprint:setup` (creates `project-goals.md` and `project-map.md`)
- Sprint directory created via `/sprint:new` (generates `.claude/sprint/[N]/specs.md`)
- Understanding of the sprint phase lifecycle (see the `sprint-workflow` skill)

## Instructions

1. Open the generated `specs.md` file at `.claude/sprint/[N]/specs.md` and define a concise goal statement at the top. State what the sprint delivers in one sentence (e.g., "Add user authentication with email/password login").
2. Define explicit scope boundaries using **In Scope** and **Out of Scope** sections. List specific features, endpoints, or components in each. Agents only implement what appears in scope; ambiguity leads to drift.
3. Add the **Testing** section to control which testing agents run and how. Configure three settings as documented in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/testing-configuration.md`:
   - `QA`: `required` | `optional` | `skip` -- Controls API and unit test execution
   - `UI Testing`: `required` | `optional` | `skip` -- Controls browser-based E2E tests
   - `UI Testing Mode`: `automated` | `manual` -- Auto-run or user-driven testing
4. Set QA to `required` for new API endpoints, business logic changes, and data validation rules. Set QA to `skip` for frontend-only changes, documentation updates, or configuration changes.
5. Set UI Testing to `required` for user-facing features, form submissions, and navigation flows. Choose `automated` mode for regression testing and standard CRUD flows; choose `manual` mode for complex interactions, visual verification, or exploratory testing.
6. Keep specifications minimal but precise. The architect expands high-level specs into detailed implementation files (`backend-specs.md`, `frontend-specs.md`, `api-contract.md`). Over-specifying implementation details in `specs.md` constrains the architect unnecessarily.
7. For iterative sprints, review `status.md` from the previous iteration. Remove completed items from specs and add any new requirements or bug fixes discovered during testing.

## Output

- A complete `specs.md` file with goal, scope (in/out), and testing configuration
- Clear scope boundaries that prevent agent drift during implementation
- Testing configuration that selects appropriate QA and UI testing agents
- Iteratively refined specs where completed work is removed and remaining work is focused

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Agents implement unintended features | Missing "Out of Scope" section | Explicitly list features excluded from this sprint |
| Tests not running during sprint | Testing section omitted or set to `skip` | Add `QA: required` and `UI Testing: required` to the Testing section |
| Sprint iterates without converging | Specs too broad for a single sprint | Break into smaller sprints targeting one domain boundary each |
| Architect produces conflicting spec files | Ambiguous or contradictory requirements in `specs.md` | Review for conflicting statements; each requirement should have a single interpretation |
| Manual tests not triggered | `UI Testing Mode` set to `automated` | Change to `manual` for scenarios requiring visual verification or exploratory testing |

## Examples

**Minimal but effective spec:**

```markdown
# Sprint 1: User Authentication

## Goal
Add user authentication with email/password login

## Scope
### In Scope
- Registration endpoint (POST /auth/register)
- Login endpoint (POST /auth/login)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Out of Scope
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Password reset flow
- Email verification

## Testing
- QA: required
- UI Testing: required
- UI Testing Mode: automated
```

**Frontend-only sprint (no QA needed):**

```markdown
# Sprint 3: Dashboard Redesign

## Goal
Redesign the admin dashboard with responsive layout

## Scope
### In Scope
- Responsive grid layout for dashboard widgets
- Dark mode toggle
- Mobile navigation drawer

### Out of Scope
- New API endpoints
- Database changes
- Authentication changes

## Testing
- QA: skip
- UI Testing: required
- UI Testing Mode: manual
```
