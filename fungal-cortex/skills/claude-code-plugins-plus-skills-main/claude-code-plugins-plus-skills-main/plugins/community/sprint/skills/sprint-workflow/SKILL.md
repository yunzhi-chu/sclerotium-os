# Sprint Workflow

## Overview

Sprint Workflow describes the convergent diffusion execution model used by the Sprint plugin. A sprint progresses through six distinct phases -- from loading specifications through architectural planning, parallel implementation, testing, review, and finalization.

## Prerequisites

- Sprint plugin installed (`/plugin install sprint`)
- Project onboarded via `/sprint:setup` (creates `.claude/project-goals.md` and `.claude/project-map.md`)
- Sprint created via `/sprint:new` with a completed `specs.md`
- Understanding of the agent system (see the `agent-patterns` skill)

## Instructions

1. **Phase 0 -- Load Specifications.** The orchestrator locates the sprint directory at `.claude/sprint/[N]/`, reads `specs.md` for requirements, reads `status.md` if resuming a prior iteration, and detects the project type for framework-specific agent selection. See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sprint-phases.md` for the full phase reference.
2. **Phase 1 -- Architectural Planning.** The project-architect agent reads `project-map.md` for architecture context and `project-goals.md` for business objectives. It produces specification files (`api-contract.md`, `backend-specs.md`, `frontend-specs.md`) and returns SPAWN REQUEST blocks for implementation agents.
3. **Phase 2 -- Implementation.** The orchestrator spawns implementation agents in parallel based on the architect's SPAWN REQUEST blocks. Agents include `python-dev`, `nextjs-dev`, `cicd-agent`, and `allpurpose-agent`. Each agent reads its assigned spec files and the shared `api-contract.md`, then returns a structured report.
4. **Phase 3 -- Testing.** Testing agents execute sequentially: `qa-test-agent` runs first (API and unit tests), then `ui-test-agent` runs browser-based E2E tests. Framework-specific diagnostics agents (e.g., `nextjs-diagnostics-agent`) run in parallel with UI tests. All agents produce test reports.
5. **Phase 4 -- Review and Iteration.** The architect reviews all agent reports, analyzes conformity against specifications, updates specs (removing completed items, adding fixes for failures), and updates `status.md`. The architect then decides: spawn more implementation agents, run more tests, or finalize.
6. **Phase 5 -- Finalization.** The orchestrator writes the final `status.md` summary, ensures all spec files are in a consistent state, cleans up temporary files like `manual-test-report.md`, and signals FINALIZE to end the sprint.
7. **Convergence model.** Each iteration reduces noise: completed work is removed from specs, working code is preserved, and only failures are re-addressed. Most sprints converge within 3-5 iterations. After 5 iterations without convergence, the orchestrator pauses and prompts for manual intervention.

## Output

- Phase-by-phase execution log showing agent spawns, reports, and decisions
- Updated `status.md` after each iteration reflecting completed and remaining work
- Specification files that shrink with each iteration as requirements are satisfied
- Final `status.md` summary upon sprint completion
- FINALIZE signal to the orchestrator when all specs are satisfied

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Sprint stuck in iteration loop (hits 5 iterations) | Specs too broad or contain unresolvable conflicts | Review `status.md` for blocking issues; narrow scope or resolve conflicting requirements |
| Phase 2 agents not spawned | Architect SPAWN REQUEST missing or malformed | Verify architect agent produced valid SPAWN REQUEST blocks with correct agent names |
| Tests fail repeatedly on same issue | Implementation does not match contract | Compare agent output against `api-contract.md`; check for schema mismatches |
| Sprint cannot find specs | Wrong sprint directory number | Verify `.claude/sprint/[N]/specs.md` exists; run `/sprint:new` if needed |
| Architect skips testing phase | Testing section missing from `specs.md` | Add `QA: required` and `UI Testing: required` to the specs (see `spec-writing` skill) |

## Examples

**Starting a new sprint:**

```bash
/sprint:new       # Creates .claude/sprint/1/specs.md
# Edit specs.md with requirements
/sprint           # Executes the full phase lifecycle
```

**Resuming after iteration pause:**

```bash
# Review .claude/sprint/1/status.md for blockers
# Adjust specs.md to narrow scope or fix conflicts
/sprint           # Resumes from Phase 0, reads updated specs and status
```

**Typical convergence flow:**

```
Iteration 1: Architect plans → 3 agents implement → tests find 2 failures
Iteration 2: Architect narrows specs to 2 fixes → agents patch → tests pass
Iteration 3: All specs satisfied → FINALIZE
```
