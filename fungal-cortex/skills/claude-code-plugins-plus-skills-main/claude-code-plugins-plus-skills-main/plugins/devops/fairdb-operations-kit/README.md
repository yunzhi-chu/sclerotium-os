# Wasabi S3
WASABI_ACCESS_KEY=<access-key>
WASABI_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>
WASABI_BUCKET=<bucket-name>
WASABI_ENDPOINT=<region-endpoint>

# PostgreSQL

```

## Usage Examples

### Complete New Customer Setup

```
User: "I need to onboard Acme Corp as a new FairDB customer"

Claude: I'll help you onboard Acme Corp. Let me use the fairdb-onboard-customer command...

[Executes complete workflow]:
✅ Database created: acme_corp_db
✅ Users created with secure passwords
✅ Network access configured for customer IPs
✅ Backups scheduled (daily at 3 AM)
✅ SSL certificates generated
✅ Monitoring enabled
✅ Connection documentation generated

Customer can now connect using:
postgresql://acme_corp_user:<password>@fairdb.example.com:5432/acme_corp_db?sslmode=require
```

### Emergency Response

```
User: "Critical: customers reporting connection failures!"

Claude: Initiating emergency response with fairdb-emergency-response...

[STEP 1] SERVICE STATUS CHECK
❌ CRITICAL: PostgreSQL is DOWN
Attempting emergency restart...
✅ PostgreSQL restarted successfully

[STEP 2] CONNECTION DIAGNOSTICS
Connections: 198/200 (99% utilized)
Terminating idle connections...
✅ Freed 47 connections

[STEP 3] PERFORMANCE TRIAGE
Found 3 long-running queries (>30 minutes)
Cancelling problematic queries...
✅ Performance restored

Root Cause: Connection pool exhaustion due to application bug
Resolution: Service restored, customer notified, RCA documented
```

### Health Monitoring

```
User: "Run a health check on FairDB infrastructure"

Claude: Running comprehensive health check with fairdb-health-check...

[1/10] SERVER RESOURCES
✅ CPU: 42% | Memory: 68% | Disk: 71%

[2/10] POSTGRESQL SERVICE
✅ Running | Version: 16.1 | Uptime: 47 days

[3/10] DATABASE CONNECTIONS
Active: 87/200 (43.5%)

[4/10] BACKUP STATUS
✅ Last backup: 2 hours ago
✅ All customer stanzas current

[10/10] OVERALL HEALTH: GOOD
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- Always use SSL/TLS connections
- Rotate passwords quarterly
- Keep IP allowlists updated
- Regular security audits
- Encrypted backups only

### Performance

- Monitor connection pools
- Regular VACUUM ANALYZE
- Index optimization
- Query performance reviews
- Resource usage tracking

### Reliability

- Test restores monthly
- Document all procedures
- Maintain runbooks
- Practice incident response
- Keep backups current

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PostgreSQL Won't Start**

```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u postgresql -n 50

# Verify data directory
sudo -u postgres pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/16/main status

# Check port conflicts
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 5432
```

**Backup Failures**

```bash
# Check pgBackRest status
sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=fairdb check

# Verify S3 connectivity
aws s3 ls s3://bucket --endpoint-url=https://s3.wasabisys.com

# Review backup logs
tail -f /var/log/pgbackrest/fairdb-backup.log
```

**High Connection Usage**

```bash
# View active connections
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Kill idle connections
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle' AND state_change < NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';"
```
