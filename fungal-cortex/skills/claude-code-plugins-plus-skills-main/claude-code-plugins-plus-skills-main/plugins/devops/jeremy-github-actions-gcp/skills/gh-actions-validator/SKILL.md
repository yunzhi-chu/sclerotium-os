# Gh Actions Validator

## Overview

Validate and harden GitHub Actions workflows that deploy to Google Cloud (especially Vertex AI) using Workload Identity Federation (OIDC) instead of long-lived service account keys. Use this to audit existing workflows, propose a secure replacement, and add CI checks that prevent common credential and permission mistakes.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- gcloud CLI authenticated with admin permissions
- Understanding of Workload Identity Federation concepts
- GitHub repository secrets configured
- Appropriate IAM roles for CI/CD automation

## Instructions

1. **Audit Existing Workflows**: Scan .github/workflows/ for security issues
2. **Validate WIF Usage**: Ensure no JSON service account keys are used
3. **Check OIDC Permissions**: Verify id-token: write is present
4. **Review IAM Roles**: Confirm least privilege (no owner/editor roles)
5. **Add Security Scans**: Include secret detection and vulnerability scanning
6. **Validate Deployments**: Add post-deployment health checks
7. **Configure Monitoring**: Set up alerts for deployment failures
8. **Document WIF Setup**: Provide one-time WIF configuration commands

## Output

      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Authenticate to GCP (WIF)
      - name: Deploy to Vertex AI
            --project=${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }} \
            --region=us-central1
      - name: Validate Deployment
