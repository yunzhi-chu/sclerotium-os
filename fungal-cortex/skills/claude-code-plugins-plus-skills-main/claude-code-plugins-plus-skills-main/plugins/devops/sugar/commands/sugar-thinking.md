# Sugar Thinking Command

View Claude's thinking logs for task execution, providing visibility into Claude's reasoning process during autonomous task execution.

## Usage

```
/sugar-thinking [TASK_ID] [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

The `sugar-thinking` command allows you to view the captured thinking blocks from Claude's execution of tasks. This provides critical visibility into how Claude approaches problems and makes decisions during autonomous development.

## Arguments

- `TASK_ID` - Task ID to view thinking for (required unless using `--list`)

## Options

- `--list, -l` - List all available thinking logs
- `--stats, -s` - Show thinking statistics only (blocks count, characters, tools considered)

## Examples

### View Full Thinking Log

```
/sugar-thinking task-abc123
```

Shows the complete thinking log with timestamped thinking blocks.

### View Statistics Only

```
/sugar-thinking task-abc123 --stats
```

Shows summary statistics including:

- Total thinking blocks captured
- Total characters
- Average thinking block length
- Tools considered during thinking
- Timing information

### List All Thinking Logs

```
/sugar-thinking --list
```

Lists all available thinking logs sorted by modification time (newest first).

## Output Format

## 10:30:05

First, I need to understand the current authentication system...

## 10:30:12

*Considering tool: `Read`*

I should read the existing auth module to see what's already implemented...
