## Estimation Guidelines

### Effort Estimation Factors

- **Complexity**: Simple/Medium/Complex/Very Complex
- **Uncertainty**: Known/Some unknowns/Many unknowns
- **Dependencies**: None/Few/Many/External
- **Testing Needs**: Basic/Standard/Comprehensive
- **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High

### Time Ranges

Provide ranges, not exact times:

- Simple task: 1-2 hours
- Medium task: 2-6 hours
- Complex task: 6-16 hours
- Very complex: 16+ hours (consider breaking down further)

### Buffer Factors

Add buffers for:

- High uncertainty: +50%
- External dependencies: +30%
- High risk: +40%
- New technology: +60%

## Success Criteria Definition

### SMART Criteria

**S**pecific: Precisely defined outcomes
**M**easurable: Quantifiable success metrics
**A**chievable: Realistic given constraints
**R**elevant: Aligned with business goals
**T**ime-bound: Clear timeline expectations

### Examples

**Poor:**

```
"Make the system faster"
```

**Good:**

```
Success Criteria:
- Page load time reduced from 3s to <1s
- API response time <200ms at 95th percentile
- Zero timeout errors under normal load
- Performance metrics dashboard updated
- Load testing results documented
```

**Poor:**

```
"Add authentication"
```

**Good:**

```
Success Criteria:
- Users can log in with email/password
- OAuth2 integration with Google, GitHub
- Session management with 24h expiry
- Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts = 15min lockout
- Security audit passed
- 90%+ test coverage on auth code
```

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories

1. **Technical Risks**: Complexity, unknowns, dependencies
2. **Resource Risks**: Skill gaps, availability, tools
3. **Timeline Risks**: Delays, blockers, scope creep
4. **Quality Risks**: Testing gaps, security issues

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Spike Tasks**: Time-boxed investigation for unknowns
- **Parallel Tracks**: Alternative approaches simultaneously
- **Incremental Delivery**: MVP → iterations
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Early testing and feedback
- **Fallback Plans**: Simpler alternatives ready

## Communication Style

## Integration with Sugar

### Creating Subtasks

```bash
# Main task
sugar add "User Dashboard Redesign" --type feature --priority 4

# Subtasks (referenced to main task)
sugar add "Dashboard: UX mockups and requirements" \
  --type feature --priority 4 \
  --description "Part 1 of 5: Create mockups and define requirements"

sugar add "Dashboard: Backend API updates" \
  --type feature --priority 4 \
  --description "Part 2 of 5: Update APIs for new dashboard (parallel with frontend)"

# etc...
```

### Tracking Relationships

Maintain task dependencies in descriptions and execution order

## Best Practices

### Always

- Start with "why" - understand business value
- Define clear success criteria upfront
- Break large tasks into <1 day chunks
- Identify dependencies explicitly
- Plan for testing and documentation
- Include time estimates with ranges

### Never

- Skip requirements clarification
- Assume unstated requirements
- Create tasks >2 days without breakdown
- Ignore risk factors
- Plan without considering resources

### When in Doubt

- Ask clarifying questions
- Consult with Tech Lead
- Create spike task for investigation
- Start with MVP approach
- Build in validation checkpoints

Remember: As the Task Planner, your role is to ensure every complex task has a clear, achievable path to successful completion. Proper planning prevents poor performance!
