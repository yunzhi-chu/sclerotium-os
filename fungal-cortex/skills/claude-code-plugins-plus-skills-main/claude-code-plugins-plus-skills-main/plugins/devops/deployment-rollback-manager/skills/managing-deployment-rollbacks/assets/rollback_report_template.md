# Rollback Report

This report documents the rollback process, its reasons, actions taken, and outcomes.

## 1. Executive Summary

[**Placeholder: Briefly summarize the reason for the rollback, the actions taken, and the overall outcome. Was the rollback successful? Are there any ongoing issues?**]

*Example: A critical bug was discovered in version 2.5.0 of the application. A rollback to version 2.4.0 was initiated. The rollback was successful, and the application is now stable. Further investigation into the bug in version 2.5.0 is underway.*

## 2. Rollback Trigger

### 2.1. Reason for Rollback

[**Placeholder: Describe in detail the reason for initiating the rollback. What specific issue or incident triggered the decision?**]

*Example: After deploying version 2.5.0, users reported intermittent server errors (HTTP 500). Monitoring dashboards showed a significant spike in error rates and a degradation in application performance.*

### 2.2. Severity Level

[**Placeholder: Indicate the severity level of the issue that triggered the rollback.**]

*Possible values: Critical, High, Medium, Low*

*Example: Critical*

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

[**Placeholder: Describe the impact of the issue on users, services, and the business.**]

*Example: The server errors were preventing users from completing critical transactions, impacting revenue and user satisfaction. The incident also affected the availability of a key API used by partner applications.*

## 3. Rollback Procedure

### 3.1. Rollback Plan

[**Placeholder: Outline the planned steps for the rollback. Include specific versions, scripts, and commands used.**]

*Example:

1. Verify the integrity of the previous version (2.4.0) backup.
2. Stop the current version (2.5.0) deployment.
3. Deploy the backup version (2.4.0).
4. Run database migrations to revert to the previous schema (if applicable).
5. Verify application functionality and performance.
6. Monitor system logs for any errors.*

### 3.2. Rollback Execution

[**Placeholder: Document the actual steps taken during the rollback process. Note any deviations from the original plan and the reasons for those deviations.**]

*Example: The rollback was executed as planned, with the exception of a minor issue with database migration scripts. A slight modification was made to the script to ensure compatibility with the current database state. This was documented in the database migration log.*

### 3.3. Rollback Time

[**Placeholder: Record the start and end times of the rollback process.**]

*Example:

* Start Time: 2024-01-26 10:00 UTC
* End Time: 2024-01-26 10:45 UTC*

### 3.4. Personnel Involved

[**Placeholder: List the individuals involved in the rollback process and their roles.**]

*Example:

* John Doe: Lead Engineer
* Jane Smith: Database Administrator
* Peter Jones: Operations Engineer*

## 4. Post-Rollback Analysis

### 4.1. Verification of Rollback Success

[**Placeholder: Describe how the success of the rollback was verified. Include specific tests and monitoring metrics used.**]

*Example: After the rollback, application functionality was tested using automated integration tests and manual user acceptance testing. Monitoring dashboards showed a return to normal error rates and application performance.*

### 4.2. Root Cause Analysis (Initial)

[**Placeholder: Provide an initial assessment of the root cause of the issue that triggered the rollback. This may be a preliminary investigation and may require further analysis.**]

*Example: The initial investigation suggests that a recently introduced code change in the payment processing module caused the server errors. Further code review and debugging are required to pinpoint the exact cause.*

### 4.3. Corrective Actions

[**Placeholder: Outline the planned corrective actions to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.**]

*Example:

1. Conduct a thorough code review of the payment processing module.
2. Implement more robust unit and integration tests for critical code paths.
3. Improve monitoring and alerting to detect issues earlier.
4. Implement a canary deployment strategy for future releases.*

### 4.4. Lessons Learned

[**Placeholder: Document any lessons learned from the rollback process. What went well? What could be improved?**]

*Example:

* The rollback process was well-documented and executed efficiently.
* The monitoring dashboards provided valuable insights into the issue.
* The communication between teams was effective.
* Areas for improvement:
  * Improve the speed of database migrations.
  * Automate the rollback process further.*
