# Creating Ansible Playbooks

## Overview

Generate production-ready Ansible playbooks, roles, and inventories for infrastructure automation. Supports provisioning servers, deploying applications, configuring services, and enforcing desired state across fleets of machines using SSH-based agentless automation.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible 2.14+ installed (`ansible --version`)
- SSH access to target hosts with key-based authentication
- Python 3.9+ on control node and managed nodes
- Inventory of target hosts (IPs or hostnames)
- Privilege escalation credentials (sudo) if configuring system-level resources
- `ansible-lint` installed for playbook validation

## Instructions

1. Scan the project for existing Ansible files (`ansible.cfg`, `inventory/`, `roles/`, `group_vars/`) to understand current structure
2. Determine the automation target: server provisioning, application deployment, configuration management, or security hardening
3. Create the playbook YAML with proper structure: `hosts`, `become`, `vars`, `tasks`, `handlers`
4. Extract reusable logic into roles using the standard directory layout (`tasks/`, `handlers/`, `templates/`, `defaults/`, `vars/`, `meta/`)
5. Define variables in `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` for environment-specific values, keeping secrets in `vault`-encrypted files
6. Use Jinja2 templates for configuration files that vary across environments
7. Add handlers for service restarts triggered by configuration changes
8. Validate the playbook with `ansible-lint` and `ansible-playbook --check --diff` (dry run)
9. Test idempotency by running the playbook twice and confirming no changes on the second run

## Output

- Ansible playbooks (`.yml`) with structured tasks, handlers, and variables
- Role directories following Ansible Galaxy structure
- Jinja2 templates (`.j2`) for dynamic configuration files
- Inventory files (INI or YAML) with host groups
- `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` for environment separation
- `ansible.cfg` with connection and privilege escalation settings

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `unreachable: Failed to connect to host` | SSH connection failure or wrong host/port | Verify SSH keys, host IPs, and that port 22 is open with `ansible -m ping` |
| `permission denied` on become | Missing or incorrect sudo password | Add `--ask-become-pass` or configure `ansible_become_password` in vault |
| `undefined variable` | Variable not defined in vars, defaults, or inventory | Check variable precedence; define in `defaults/main.yml` or `group_vars/` |
| `ansible-lint: syntax-check failed` | YAML syntax error or deprecated module usage | Run `ansible-lint -v` and fix reported issues; replace deprecated modules |
| `changed` on every run (not idempotent) | Using `command`/`shell` without `creates`/`removes` guards | Add `creates:` parameter or switch to purpose-built modules (`copy`, `template`, `file`) |

## Examples

- "Create an Ansible playbook to provision an Ubuntu 22.04 server with Nginx, Certbot, and a firewall allowing only 80/443."
- "Generate a role that deploys a Python Flask app with Gunicorn, systemd service file, and log rotation."
- "Write an Ansible playbook to harden SSH config across all servers: disable root login, enforce key auth, set idle timeout."
