Semantic color palette, arrow-masking SVG technique, and grid-background aesthetic are inspired by Cocoon-AI's skill. We do not reuse source code from the upstream repo — we borrow design patterns under the MIT license and credit the originators.

### Borrowed patterns

- Semantic OKLCH color palette by component role (cyan/emerald/violet/amber/rose/orange/slate)
- SVG arrow-masking technique (opaque `#0f172a` rect → styled semi-transparent rect on top)
- Grid-pattern background (40x40 units, stroke `#1e293b`, width `0.5`)
- Dashed boundary conventions for security groups (`4,4` rose) and regions (`8,4` amber, `rx="12"`)
- 40px minimum vertical spacing heuristic for component rows
- JetBrains Mono typography

### Original contributions (not borrowed)

- DCI-grounded topology inference from package manifests, docker-compose, k8s, terraform
- PR-diff delta view (`git diff` → before/after architecture)
- Structural fingerprinting + drift detection
- Stack-trace-to-sequence mode
- Accessibility baseline (ARIA, `<title>`/`<desc>`, reduced-motion)
- Four-command surface
- Mermaid fallback routing
