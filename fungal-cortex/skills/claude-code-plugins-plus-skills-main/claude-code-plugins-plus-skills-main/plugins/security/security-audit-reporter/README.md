## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Summary

```
SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
=====================
Organization: Example Corp
Audit Date: 2025-10-11
Auditor: Security Team

OVERALL SECURITY POSTURE: MODERATE RISK

Risk Score: 6.5/10 (Previous: 7.2/10) ↓ Improving
- Critical Issues: 2
- High Issues: 12
- Medium Issues: 34
- Low Issues: 67

TOP RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Address SQL injection in customer portal (CRITICAL)
2. Implement multi-factor authentication (HIGH)
3. Upgrade vulnerable dependencies (HIGH)
4. Enable security logging (MEDIUM)
```

### 2. Vulnerability Details

```
CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES
------------------------

CVE-2023-XXXX: SQL Injection in Authentication
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.8)
Location: /api/auth/login
Status: Open
Age: 45 days

Description:
The login endpoint does not use parameterized queries,
allowing SQL injection via the username parameter.

Proof of Concept:
username=' OR '1'='1' --

Impact:
- Complete database access
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration
- Account takeover

Remediation:
1. Implement parameterized queries
2. Add input validation
3. Deploy WAF rules
4. Test fix with penetration testing

Estimated Effort: 4 hours
Priority: Immediate
```

### 3. Compliance Status

```
COMPLIANCE DASHBOARD
====================

OWASP Top 10 (2021): 70% Coverage
 A01: Broken Access Control - Partial
 A02: Cryptographic Failures - Non-Compliant
 A03: Injection - Addressed
 A04: Insecure Design - Issues Found
...

GDPR Compliance: 85%
 Data encryption at rest
 Right to deletion implemented
 Data processing agreements incomplete
 Privacy policy published

PCI-DSS: 60% (Not Ready for Audit)
 Requirement 2: Default passwords not changed
 Requirement 3: Cardholder data encrypted
 Requirement 6: Unpatched vulnerabilities exist
```

### 4. Security Controls Assessment

```
AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
-------------------------------
 Password hashing (bcrypt)
 Multi-factor authentication (Not implemented)
 Session management (Secure cookies)
 Account lockout (Not configured)
 Password policy (12+ chars, complexity)

ENCRYPTION
----------
 TLS 1.3 for data in transit
 AES-256 for data at rest
 Database encryption (Not enabled)
 Secure key management

LOGGING & MONITORING
--------------------
 Security event logging (Minimal)
 Intrusion detection (Not deployed)
 Error logging
 Audit trail (Incomplete)
```

### 5. Remediation Roadmap

```
PRIORITY 1 - IMMEDIATE (0-7 days)
----------------------------------
1. Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities (4 hours)
2. Rotate exposed API keys (2 hours)
3. Patch critical CVEs in dependencies (4 hours)

PRIORITY 2 - SHORT TERM (1-4 weeks)
------------------------------------
4. Implement multi-factor authentication (40 hours)
5. Enable comprehensive security logging (16 hours)
6. Deploy WAF with OWASP ruleset (24 hours)
7. Implement rate limiting (8 hours)

PRIORITY 3 - MEDIUM TERM (1-3 months)
--------------------------------------
8. Complete GDPR compliance gaps (80 hours)
9. Implement database encryption (40 hours)
10. Deploy intrusion detection system (60 hours)
11. Security awareness training program (40 hours)

PRIORITY 4 - LONG TERM (3-6 months)
------------------------------------
12. SOC2 Type II audit preparation (200 hours)
13. Implement zero-trust architecture (300 hours)
14. Establish bug bounty program (ongoing)
```
