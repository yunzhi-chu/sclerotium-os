# Ssl Certificate Manager

Monitor SSL/TLS certificate expiry dates, automate renewal workflows, list installed certificates, and diagnose certificate chain or configuration issues across domains.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to seamlessly interact with the ssl-certificate-manager plugin, facilitating efficient management and monitoring of SSL/TLS certificates. It allows for quick checks of certificate expiry dates, automated renewal processes, and comprehensive listings of installed certificates.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Intent**: Claude analyzes the user's request for keywords related to SSL/TLS certificate management.
2. **Plugin Activation**: The ssl-certificate-manager plugin is automatically activated.
3. **Command Execution**: Based on the user's request, Claude executes the appropriate command within the plugin (e.g., checking expiry, renewing certificate, listing certificates).
4. **Result Presentation**: Claude presents the results of the command execution to the user in a clear and concise format.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Check the expiry date of an SSL/TLS certificate.
- Renew an SSL/TLS certificate.
- List all installed SSL/TLS certificates.
- Investigate SSL/TLS certificate issues.

## Examples

### Example 1: Checking Certificate Expiry

User request: "Check the expiry date of my SSL certificate for example.com"

The skill will:

1. Activate the ssl-certificate-manager plugin.
2. Execute the command to check the expiry date for the specified domain.
3. Display the expiry date to the user.

### Example 2: Renewing a Certificate

User request: "Renew my SSL certificate for api.example.org"

The skill will:

1. Activate the ssl-certificate-manager plugin.
2. Execute the command to renew the SSL certificate for the specified domain.
3. Confirm the renewal process to the user.

## Best Practices

- **Specificity**: Provide the full domain name when requesting certificate checks or renewals.
- **Context**: If encountering errors, provide the full error message to Claude for better troubleshooting.
- **Verification**: After renewal, always verify the new certificate is correctly installed and functioning.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other security-related plugins to provide a comprehensive security overview. For example, it can be integrated with vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses related to outdated or misconfigured certificates.
