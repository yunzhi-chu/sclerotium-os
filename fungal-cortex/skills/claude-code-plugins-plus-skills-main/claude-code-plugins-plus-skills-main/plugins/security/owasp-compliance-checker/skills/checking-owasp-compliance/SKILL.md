# Owasp Compliance Checker

Assess web applications against the OWASP Top 10, identifying injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XXE, access control gaps, and security misconfigurations.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to assess your project's adherence to the OWASP Top 10 (2021) security guidelines. It automates the process of identifying potential vulnerabilities related to common web application security risks, providing actionable insights to improve your application's security posture.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Scan**: The skill activates the owasp-compliance-checker plugin upon request.
2. **Analyze Codebase**: The plugin scans the codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to each OWASP Top 10 category.
3. **Generate Report**: A detailed report is generated, highlighting compliance gaps and providing specific remediation guidance for each identified issue.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Evaluate your application's security posture against the OWASP Top 10 (2021).
- Identify potential vulnerabilities related to common web application security risks.
- Obtain actionable remediation guidance to address identified vulnerabilities.
- Generate a compliance report for auditing or reporting purposes.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

User request: "Check OWASP compliance for SQL injection vulnerabilities."

The skill will:

1. Activate the owasp-compliance-checker plugin.
2. Scan the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. Generate a report highlighting any identified SQL injection vulnerabilities and providing remediation guidance.

### Example 2: Assessing Overall OWASP Compliance

User request: "/owasp"

The skill will:

1. Activate the owasp-compliance-checker plugin.
2. Scan the entire codebase for vulnerabilities across all OWASP Top 10 categories.
3. Generate a comprehensive report detailing compliance gaps and remediation steps for each category.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scanning**: Integrate OWASP compliance checks into your development workflow for continuous security monitoring.
- **Prioritize Remediation**: Address identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep your OWASP compliance checker plugin updated to benefit from the latest vulnerability detection rules and remediation guidance.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other plugins to automate vulnerability remediation or generate comprehensive security reports. For example, it can be used in conjunction with a code modification plugin to automatically apply recommended fixes for identified vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Access to codebase and configuration files in ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/
- Security scanning tools installed as needed
- Understanding of security standards and best practices
- Permissions for security analysis operations

## Instructions

1. Identify security scan scope and targets
2. Configure scanning parameters and thresholds
3. Execute security analysis systematically
4. Analyze findings for vulnerabilities and compliance gaps
5. Prioritize issues by severity and impact
6. Generate detailed security report with remediation steps

## Output

- Security scan results with vulnerability details
- Compliance status reports by standard
- Prioritized list of security issues by severity
- Remediation recommendations with code examples
- Executive summary for stakeholders

## Error Handling

If security scanning fails:

- Verify tool installation and configuration
- Check file and directory permissions
- Validate scan target paths
- Review tool-specific error messages
- Ensure network access for dependency checks
