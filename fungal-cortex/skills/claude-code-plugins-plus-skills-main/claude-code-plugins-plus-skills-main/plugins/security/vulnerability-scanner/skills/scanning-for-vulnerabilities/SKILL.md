# Vulnerability Scanner

Scan codebases, dependencies, and configurations for security vulnerabilities including CVE detection, code-level flaws, and insecure defaults, with severity ratings and remediation steps.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to automatically scan your codebase for security vulnerabilities. It leverages the vulnerability-scanner plugin to identify potential risks, including code-level flaws, vulnerable dependencies, and insecure configurations.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Scan**: The skill activates the vulnerability-scanner plugin based on user input.
2. **Perform Analysis**: The plugin scans the codebase, dependencies, and configurations for vulnerabilities, including CVE detection.
3. **Generate Report**: The plugin creates a detailed vulnerability report with findings, severity levels, and remediation guidance.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Identify security vulnerabilities in your code.
- Check your project's dependencies for known CVEs.
- Review your project's configurations for security weaknesses.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying SQL Injection Risks

User request: "Scan my code for SQL injection vulnerabilities."

The skill will:

1. Activate the vulnerability-scanner plugin.
2. Analyze the codebase for potential SQL injection flaws.
3. Generate a report highlighting any identified SQL injection risks and providing remediation steps.

### Example 2: Checking for Vulnerable npm Packages

User request: "Check my project's npm dependencies for known vulnerabilities."

The skill will:

1. Activate the vulnerability-scanner plugin.
2. Scan the project's `package.json` file and identify any npm packages with known CVEs.
3. Generate a report listing the vulnerable packages, their CVE identifiers, and recommended updates.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scanning**: Run vulnerability scans regularly, especially before deployments.
- **Prioritize Remediation**: Focus on addressing critical and high-severity vulnerabilities first.
- **Validate Fixes**: After applying fixes, run another scan to ensure the vulnerabilities are resolved.

## Integration

This skill integrates with the core Claude Code environment by providing automated vulnerability scanning capabilities. It can be used in conjunction with other plugins to create a comprehensive security workflow, such as integrating with a ticketing system to automatically create tickets for identified vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Appropriate file access permissions
- Required dependencies installed

## Instructions
