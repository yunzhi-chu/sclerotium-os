SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE
==========================
Incident ID: INC-2025-10-11-001
Date: 2025-10-11 14:30 UTC
Severity: HIGH
Type: Data Breach - SQL Injection

INITIAL ASSESSMENT
------------------
Detection Method: Automated alerting
Affected Systems: Production database
Data at Risk: User credentials (50,000 records)
Attack Vector: SQL injection in login endpoint

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-1 hour)
-----------------------------
 1. Isolate affected system [14:35 UTC]
 2. Block attacker IP addresses [14:40 UTC]
 3. Preserve logs and evidence [14:45 UTC]
 4. Notify security team [14:50 UTC]
□ 5. Deploy WAF rules [In Progress]

CONTAINMENT (1-4 hours)
-----------------------
□ 1. Take database snapshot
□ 2. Patch SQL injection vulnerability
□ 3. Review all database queries
□ 4. Enable query logging
□ 5. Deploy intrusion detection

INVESTIGATION
-------------
Timeline:
- 14:15 UTC: Attacker begins probing
- 14:20 UTC: Successful SQL injection
- 14:25 UTC: Data exfiltration begins
- 14:30 UTC: Automated alert triggers
- 14:35 UTC: Response initiated

Evidence Collected:
- Web server logs
- Database query logs
- Network packet captures
- Application error logs

Attack Details:
POST /api/login
username: admin' UNION SELECT username,password,email FROM users--
Result: Full user table extracted

REMEDIATION STEPS
-----------------
1. Fix SQL injection (IMMEDIATE)
   - Replace with parameterized queries
   - Deploy within 2 hours

2. Force password reset (HIGH)
   - Reset all user passwords
   - Notify users of breach
   - Complete within 24 hours

3. Enable MFA (HIGH)
   - Implement TOTP-based MFA
   - Deploy within 1 week

4. Database encryption (MEDIUM)
   - Enable at-rest encryption
   - Complete within 2 weeks

COMMUNICATION PLAN
------------------
Internal:
- Security team: Immediate notification (Complete)
- Engineering team: Within 1 hour (Complete)
- Management: Within 2 hours (Pending)
- Legal: Within 4 hours (Pending)

External:
- Affected users: Within 72 hours (Required by GDPR)
- Regulatory bodies: Within 72 hours (Required by GDPR)
- Law enforcement: If criminal activity confirmed

POST-INCIDENT ACTIONS
--------------------
□ 1. Document lessons learned
□ 2. Update incident response plan
□ 3. Conduct security training
□ 4. Implement additional controls
□ 5. Schedule follow-up review (30 days)
```

## Response Playbooks

### Data Breach Response

1. Identify scope of breach
2. Contain affected systems
3. Assess data exposure
4. Preserve evidence
5. Notify stakeholders
6. Regulatory reporting
7. Remediation
8. Post-breach monitoring

### Ransomware Response

1. Isolate infected systems
2. Identify ransomware variant
3. Assess backup integrity
4. Evaluate payment vs. recovery
5. Notify authorities
6. Restore from backups
