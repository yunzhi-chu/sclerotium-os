---

### `reserveDevice`

## 2. Session Management

### `listSessions`

List test sessions with filters. Returns session ID, status, device info, duration, and timestamps.

**Prompt examples:**

> "Show me all running sessions"

> "List my last 5 failed iOS sessions"

> "Show sessions running on Pixel devices"

---

### `getSession`

Get detailed info about a specific session including commands executed, device info, desired capabilities, and test results.

**Prompt examples:**

### `uploadAppToStore`

---

### `confirmAppUpload`

## 4. Running Automation Tests

### `run-automation-suite` skill

Guided workflow that uploads your app, selects a device, parses capabilities from your local Appium script, and executes it. Supports Node.js, Python, .NET, and Java scripts.

**Pattern:**

```
Test this app <PATH_TO_APP> by my script <PATH_TO_SCRIPT> on Kobiton <PLATFORM> device <DEVICE_NAME>
```

**Prompt examples:**

> "Test this app resources/apps/GS.apk by my script resources/auto/Android_app_test.js on Kobiton Android device"

> "Test this app resources/apps/LeaderboardApp.ipa by my script tests/ios_test.py on Kobiton iOS device iPhone 15"

> "Test this app resources/apps/TurboTest.apk by my script tests/smoke_test.js on Kobiton Android device Pixel 6"
