* **Pass Rate:** `[Calculate and Insert Pass Rate (Tests Passed / Total Tests * 100)%]`

**Visual Representation (Optional):**

`[Include a chart or graph visualizing the test results (e.g., a pie chart showing the proportion of passed, failed, and skipped tests).  This can be easily created using Markdown tables or by linking to an external image.]`

Example Markdown Table:

| Status   | Count | Percentage |
| -------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Passed   | `[Insert]` | `[Insert]` |
| Failed   | `[Insert]` | `[Insert]` |
| Skipped  | `[Insert]` | `[Insert]` |

## 4. Detailed Test Results

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the results for each test within the suite.

### 4.1 Failed Tests

`[List each failed test with the following information.  Include as much detail as possible to aid in debugging.]`

* **Test Case ID:** `[Insert Test Case ID, e.g., TC_001]`
* **Test Name:** `[Insert Descriptive Test Name, e.g., "Verify User Login with Valid Credentials"]`
* **Description:** `[Briefly describe what the test is supposed to do.]`
* **Error Message:** `[Insert the exact error message returned during the test.]`
* **Stack Trace (if applicable):** `[Insert the stack trace to help pinpoint the source of the error.]`
* **Expected Result:** `[Describe the expected outcome of the test.]`
* **Actual Result:** `[Describe the actual outcome of the test.]`
* **Screenshots/Logs:** `[Link to any relevant screenshots or log files that provide more context.]`
* **Priority:** `[Assign a priority level to the failure (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).]`
* **Assigned To:** `[Indicate who is responsible for investigating and fixing the failure.]`
* **Status:** `[Indicate the current status of the failure (e.g., Open, Investigating, Fixed, Verified).]`

**Example Failed Test Entry:**

* **Test Case ID:** TC_005
* **Test Name:** Verify Password Reset Functionality
* **Description:** Checks if a user can successfully reset their password after requesting a password reset link.
* **Error Message:** `AssertionError: Password reset failed. Password was not updated in the database.`
* **Stack Trace:** `[Insert Stack Trace Here]`
* **Expected Result:** User should be able to reset their password and log in with the new password.
* **Actual Result:** Password was not updated, and user was unable to log in with the new password.
* **Screenshots/Logs:** Link to Screenshot, Link to Log File
* **Priority:** Critical
* **Assigned To:** John Doe
* **Status:** Investigating

`[Repeat the above format for each failed test.]`

### 4.2 Skipped Tests

`[List each skipped test with the following information.]`

* **Test Case ID:** `[Insert Test Case ID]`
* **Test Name:** `[Insert Test Name]`
* **Reason for Skipping:** `[Explain why the test was skipped (e.g., "Feature not yet implemented", "Dependency unavailable", "Known issue").]`

**Example Skipped Test Entry:**

* **Test Case ID:** TC_012
* **Test Name:** Verify Integration with Payment Gateway X
* **Reason for Skipping:** Payment Gateway X is currently unavailable in the test environment.

`[Repeat the above format for each skipped test.]`

## 5. Change Impact Analysis

`[Analyze the impact of the code changes on the test results.  Identify which changes are likely responsible for the failures and skipped tests.  Relate the failed tests back to the specific changes made in the commit.]`

Example:

"The failures in the user authentication tests (TC_001 and TC_002) are likely related to the changes made to the user authentication module in commit `[Insert Commit Hash]`.  Specifically, the changes to the password hashing algorithm may have introduced a bug."

## 6. Recommendations

`[Provide recommendations based on the test results.  This might include suggestions for fixing bugs, improving test coverage, or addressing performance issues.]`

Example:

* "Investigate and fix the failures in the user authentication tests immediately."
* "Add more test cases to cover edge cases in the user authentication module."
* "Consider implementing a more robust logging system to aid in debugging."

## 7. Conclusion

`[Summarize the overall findings of the regression test and reiterate any critical issues that need to be addressed.  State whether the build is ready for deployment or not.]`

Example:

"The regression test suite identified critical failures in the user authentication module.  These failures must be addressed before deploying the build to production. Further testing is recommended after the fixes are implemented."

## 8. Appendix (Optional)

`[Include any additional information that may be relevant, such as detailed log files, performance metrics, or configuration settings.]`

`[Link to full test run results if available.]`
