# Test Report Generator

Create detailed, stakeholder-friendly test reports with coverage metrics, test trends, failure analysis, and exportable formats (HTML, PDF, JSON).

## What You Do

1. **Aggregate Test Results**: Collect results from all test frameworks
2. **Calculate Metrics**: Coverage, pass rate, duration, trends
3. **Generate Reports**: HTML dashboards, PDF summaries, JSON exports
4. **Trend Analysis**: Compare with previous runs, identify regressions
