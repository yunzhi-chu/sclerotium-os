# Accessibility Test Scanner

## Overview

Validate web applications against WCAG 2.1/2.2 accessibility standards covering perceivability, operability, understandability, and robustness. Combines automated scanning with axe-core, Pa11y, and Lighthouse accessibility audits alongside manual validation checklists for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast.

## Prerequisites

- Accessibility testing library installed (axe-core, @axe-core/playwright, Pa11y, or Lighthouse CI)
- Browser automation tool (Playwright or Puppeteer) for rendering pages
- Application running and accessible at a test URL
- Target WCAG conformance level defined (A, AA, or AAA -- AA is standard)
- Color contrast analyzer (built into axe-core or standalone tool)

## Instructions

1. Configure the accessibility scanner with the target WCAG level:
   - Set axe-core rules to WCAG 2.1 AA (or 2.2 AA for latest standard).
   - Include rules for ARIA attributes, color contrast, form labels, and heading structure.
   - Define pages and components to scan (homepage, forms, modals, navigation).
2. Run automated accessibility scans on each page:
   - Use `@axe-core/playwright` to scan after page load.
   - Run Pa11y for HTML-level validation.
   - Execute Lighthouse accessibility audit for a score and detailed findings.
   - Scan each major interactive state (modal open, dropdown expanded, error state).
3. Validate keyboard navigation:
   - Verify all interactive elements are reachable via Tab key in logical order.
   - Confirm focus indicators are visible on every focusable element.
   - Test Escape key closes modals and dropdowns.
   - Verify skip-to-content link is present and functional.
   - Check that focus is trapped within open modals (no focus escape).
4. Validate ARIA implementation:
   - Check all ARIA roles match the element's purpose (`role="button"` on clickable divs).
   - Verify `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` on elements without visible text.
   - Confirm `aria-live` regions announce dynamic content changes.
   - Validate `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-checked` states toggle correctly.
5. Check color and visual accessibility:
   - Verify text contrast ratio meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
   - Ensure information is not conveyed by color alone (use icons, patterns, or text labels).
   - Test with simulated color blindness filters (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia).
6. Validate form accessibility:
   - Every input has an associated `<label>` with matching `for`/`id`.
   - Error messages are announced via `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid`.
   - Required fields are indicated with `aria-required="true"` and visual indicators.
7. Generate a compliance report with WCAG success criteria references for each finding.

## Output

- Accessibility scan results with violations, passes, and incomplete checks
- WCAG compliance matrix showing pass/fail per success criterion
- Remediation checklist with code fixes for each violation
- Keyboard navigation test results
- Lighthouse accessibility score and improvement recommendations

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| axe-core reports no violations but page is inaccessible | Automated tools catch ~30-40% of issues; manual testing needed | Supplement automated scans with keyboard and screen reader manual testing |
| Color contrast violation on dynamic theme | Theme colors computed at runtime not captured by static scan | Run scans with each theme active (light/dark); test with high-contrast mode |
| False positive on hidden content | Scanner checks elements that are visually hidden but present in DOM | Use `axe.configure({ rules: [{ id: 'rule-id', selector: ':visible' }] })` |
| ARIA role conflicts | Multiple conflicting ARIA attributes on same element | Remove redundant roles; follow WAI-ARIA authoring practices for the component pattern |
| Focus order incorrect after dynamic content | DOM insertion order differs from visual order | Use `tabindex` to correct order; restructure DOM to match visual layout |

## Examples

**Playwright + axe-core accessibility test:**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

test('homepage meets WCAG AA', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
    .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21aa'])
    .analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
});

test('login form is keyboard accessible', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  const focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.getAttribute('data-testid'));
  expect(focused).toBe('email-input');
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  const nextFocused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.getAttribute('data-testid'));
  expect(nextFocused).toBe('password-input');
});
```

**Pa11y CI configuration:**

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "standard": "WCAG2AA",
    "timeout": 10000,  # 10000: 10 seconds in ms
    "wait": 1000  # 1000: 1 second in ms
  },
  "urls": [
    "http://localhost:3000/",  # 3000: 3 seconds in ms
    "http://localhost:3000/login",  # 3 seconds in ms
    "http://localhost:3000/dashboard",  # 3 seconds in ms
    { "url": "http://localhost:3000/settings", "actions": ["click element #tab-profile"] }
  ]
}
```
