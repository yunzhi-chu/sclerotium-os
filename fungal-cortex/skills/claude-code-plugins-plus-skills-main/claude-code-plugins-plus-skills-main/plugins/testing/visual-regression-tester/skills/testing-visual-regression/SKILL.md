# Visual Regression Tester

## Overview

Detect unintended visual changes in UI components by capturing screenshots and comparing them pixel-by-pixel against approved baselines. Supports Playwright visual comparisons, Percy, Chromatic, BackstopJS, and reg-suit.

## Prerequisites

- Browser automation tool installed (Playwright, Puppeteer, or Cypress)
- Visual regression library configured (Playwright `toHaveScreenshot`, Percy, Chromatic, or BackstopJS)
- Baseline screenshots committed to version control or stored in a cloud service
- Storybook or component playground running for isolated component captures (optional)
- Consistent rendering environment (Docker or CI with fixed OS/fonts/GPU settings)

## Instructions

1. Identify all UI components and pages requiring visual coverage using Glob to scan component directories and route definitions.
2. Create a visual test file for each component or page:
   - Navigate to the component URL or Storybook story.
   - Wait for all network requests, animations, and lazy-loaded images to complete.
   - Set a consistent viewport size (e.g., 1280x720 for desktop, 375x812 for mobile).
3. Capture screenshots with deterministic settings:
   - Disable animations and transitions (`* { animation: none !important; transition: none !important; }`).
   - Mask dynamic content (timestamps, random avatars, ads) with CSS overlays.
   - Use `fullPage: true` for scrollable pages.
4. Compare captured screenshots against baselines:
   - Configure pixel difference threshold (recommended: 0.1% for component tests, 0.5% for full-page).
   - Generate diff images highlighting changed regions.
   - Flag tests as failed when differences exceed the threshold.
5. For responsive testing, capture at multiple breakpoints:
   - Mobile: 375px width
   - Tablet: 768px width
   - Desktop: 1280px width
   - Wide: 1920px width
6. Review diff images for each failure and classify as:
   - **Intentional change**: Update the baseline with `--update-snapshots`.
   - **Regression**: File a bug with the diff image attached.
7. Integrate into CI so visual tests run on every pull request with diff images uploaded as artifacts.

## Output

- Screenshot baseline images stored in `__screenshots__/` or equivalent directory
- Diff images highlighting pixel-level changes between baseline and current
- Visual regression test report with pass/fail status per component
- CI artifacts containing all captured, baseline, and diff images
- Responsive coverage matrix showing results across breakpoints

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Anti-aliasing differences across OS | Font rendering varies between macOS, Linux, and Windows | Run visual tests in Docker with fixed fonts; use `threshold` option to allow sub-pixel variance |
| Flaky screenshots from animations | CSS transitions or JS animations still running at capture time | Inject `prefers-reduced-motion` or disable animations via `addStyleTag` before capture |
| Missing baseline on first run | No previous screenshot exists to compare against | Run with `--update-snapshots` to create initial baselines; commit them to the repository |
| Viewport size mismatch | Browser chrome or scrollbar width differs between environments | Use `setViewportSize` explicitly; hide scrollbars with CSS `overflow: hidden` |
| Dynamic content causes false failures | Timestamps, user avatars, or ads change between runs | Mask dynamic elements with `mask` option or replace content via `page.evaluate` |

## Examples

**Playwright visual regression test:**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage matches baseline', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  await page.addStyleTag({ content: '* { animation: none !important; }' });
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('homepage.png', {
    maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.001,
    fullPage: true,
  });
});
```

**BackstopJS scenario configuration:**

```json
{
  "label": "Login Page",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/login",  # 3000: 3 seconds in ms
  "selectors": ["document"],
  "misMatchThreshold": 0.1,
  "viewports": [
    { "label": "phone", "width": 375, "height": 812 },  # 812: 375 = configured value
    { "label": "desktop", "width": 1280, "height": 720 }  # 1280: 720 = configured value
  ]
}
```
