# CodeRabbit Common Errors

## Overview

Quick-reference troubleshooting guide for the most common CodeRabbit issues. CodeRabbit is a GitHub/GitLab App that reviews PRs automatically -- most problems are configuration issues, permission gaps, or YAML syntax errors rather than API failures.

## Prerequisites

- CodeRabbit GitHub App installed on repository
- Access to GitHub repository settings
- `.coderabbit.yaml` in repository root

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Your Issue Category

| Symptom | Category | Jump To |
|---------|----------|---------|
| No review posted on PR | Installation/Permissions | Error 1 |
| Review on some PRs but not others | Configuration | Error 2-4 |
| Too many comments / noise | Tuning | Error 5 |
| Config changes not taking effect | YAML Issues | Error 6 |
| Bot not responding to commands | Interaction | Error 7 |
| Review takes too long | Performance | Error 8 |

### Error 1: No Review Posted on PR

**Symptoms:** PR is open, targeting main, but no CodeRabbit review appears after 15+ minutes.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Check if CodeRabbit App is installed on this repo
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/installation --jq '.app_slug' 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT INSTALLED"

# Check if the PR author has a CodeRabbit seat
# Go to app.coderabbit.ai > Organization > Seats
```

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **App not installed**: Visit https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai and install on the repo
2. **Repo not selected**: In GitHub > Installed Apps > CodeRabbit, add the specific repository
3. **No seat assigned**: The PR author needs a CodeRabbit seat (app.coderabbit.ai > Subscription)
4. **Private repo without org plan**: Free tier only works on public repos

### Error 2: Reviews Only on Some Branches

**Symptoms:** Reviews appear on PRs to `main` but not `develop` or feature branches.

**Cause:** `base_branches` filter in configuration only includes specific branches.

**Fix:**

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml
reviews:
  auto_review:
    enabled: true
    base_branches:
      - main
      - develop
      - "release/*"     # Glob patterns work
      - "hotfix/*"
      # Remove base_branches entirely to review PRs to ALL branches
```

### Error 3: Reviews Skip Certain PRs

**Symptoms:** Some PRs get reviewed, others are silently skipped.

**Diagnosis checklist:**

```yaml
# Check these .coderabbit.yaml settings:
reviews:
  auto_review:
    drafts: false           # Draft PRs are skipped (expected behavior)
    ignore_title_keywords:  # PRs with these keywords in title are skipped
      - "WIP"
      - "DO NOT MERGE"
      - "chore: bump"      # This skips dependency update PRs

# Also check: Is the PR author a bot?
# Bot PRs (dependabot, renovate) may not trigger reviews
# unless bot accounts have CodeRabbit seats
```

### Error 4: Reviews Include Generated/Unwanted Files

**Symptoms:** CodeRabbit comments on lock files, generated code, or build output.

**Fix:**

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml - Add path filters
reviews:
  path_filters:
    - "!**/*.lock"
    - "!**/package-lock.json"
    - "!**/pnpm-lock.yaml"
    - "!**/*.snap"
    - "!**/generated/**"
    - "!dist/**"
    - "!**/*.min.js"
    - "!vendor/**"
    - "!**/*.generated.*"
```

### Error 5: Too Many Comments / Review Noise

**Symptoms:** CodeRabbit posts 10-20+ comments per PR, most are nitpicks.

**Fix:**

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml - Reduce comment volume
reviews:
  profile: "chill"           # Fewer comments, only significant issues
  # Options: chill (fewest) → assertive (balanced) → nitpicky (most)

  # Give context to prevent misguided comments
  path_instructions:
    - path: "src/legacy/**"
      instructions: |
        This is legacy code. Only flag security issues and bugs.
        Do NOT suggest refactoring or style changes.
    - path: "scripts/**"
      instructions: |
        One-off scripts. Do not enforce production standards.
        Only flag: security issues, destructive ops without confirmation.
```

### Error 6: Configuration Changes Not Taking Effect

**Symptoms:** You updated `.coderabbit.yaml` but reviews behave the same way.

**Diagnosis:**

```markdown
# In a PR comment, run:
@coderabbitai configuration

# CodeRabbit will reply with the active configuration as YAML.
# Compare with your .coderabbit.yaml to find discrepancies.

# Common causes:
# 1. YAML syntax error - entire config is ignored silently
# 2. Config not on the base branch - CodeRabbit reads config from the PR's base branch
# 3. Organization-level config overriding repo config
# 4. Wrong field name (e.g., "review_instructions" instead of "path_instructions")
```

**YAML validation:**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Validate YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.coderabbit.yaml'))" && echo "YAML OK" || echo "YAML INVALID"

# Or use an online validator: https://www.yamllint.com/
```

### Error 7: Bot Not Responding to PR Comments

**Symptoms:** You post `@coderabbitai full review` but nothing happens.

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Typo in mention**: Must be exactly `@coderabbitai` (one word, lowercase)
2. **Comment in wrong location**: Commands work in PR comments, not commit comments
3. **Chat disabled**: Ensure `.coderabbit.yaml` has `chat: auto_reply: true`
4. **Rate limited**: Too many commands in quick succession; wait a few minutes

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml - Ensure chat is enabled
chat:
  auto_reply: true    # Required for @coderabbitai commands to work
```

### Error 8: Review Takes Too Long (15+ Minutes)

**Symptoms:** PR opened but CodeRabbit review not posted after 15 minutes.

**Causes:**

| PR Size | Expected Time | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| < 200 lines | 2-3 min | Normal, wait |
| 200-500 lines | 3-7 min | Normal, wait |
| 500-1000 lines | 7-12 min | Consider splitting |
| 1000+ lines | 12-15+ min | Split PR or be patient |

**If it is been 20+ minutes on a small PR:**

```markdown
1. Check CodeRabbit status: https://status.coderabbit.ai
2. Try: @coderabbitai full review (force re-review)
3. Check GitHub App installation hasn't been suspended
4. Contact support via CodeRabbit Discord or email
```

### Step 2: Verify Fix

After applying a fix, create or update a PR and confirm CodeRabbit behaves as expected:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Force a re-review on an existing PR
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "@coderabbitai full review"

# Or check the active config
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "@coderabbitai configuration"
```

## Output

- Issue identified from symptom-based diagnosis
- Configuration fix applied to `.coderabbit.yaml`
- Fix verified via re-review or configuration check

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| All reviews stopped suddenly | GitHub App permissions revoked | Reinstall CodeRabbit GitHub App |
| "This repository is not configured" | Repo removed from App access | Re-add repo in GitHub App settings |
| YAML parse error in logs | Invalid `.coderabbit.yaml` | Validate YAML syntax before committing |
| Stale reviews on old PRs | PR was created before config change | Run `@coderabbitai full review` |
