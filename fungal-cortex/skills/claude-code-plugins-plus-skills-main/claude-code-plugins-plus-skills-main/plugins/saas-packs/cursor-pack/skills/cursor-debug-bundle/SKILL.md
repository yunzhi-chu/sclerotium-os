# Cursor Debug Bundle

Diagnose and fix AI suggestion quality issues in Cursor. Covers why AI generates wrong code, how to improve context, and systematic debugging workflows.

## Diagnostic Framework

When AI suggestions are wrong, the cause is almost always one of these:

```
┌─ Context Problems (80% of issues) ───────────────────────┐
│  1. Missing context: AI doesn't have the relevant code   │
│  2. Wrong context: AI has stale or irrelevant files      │
│  3. Too much context: context window overflow            │
│  4. No project rules: AI doesn't know your conventions   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─ Model Problems (15% of issues) ─────────────────────────┐
│  5. Wrong model for the task                             │
│  6. Model hallucinating APIs or patterns                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─ Prompt Problems (5% of issues) ─────────────────────────┐
│  7. Ambiguous or vague instructions                      │
│  8. Conflicting requirements in prompt                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Debugging by Symptom

### AI Uses Wrong API or Library Version

**Symptom:** Generated code uses `React.createClass`, old Express syntax, or deprecated patterns.

**Root cause:** Model training data includes old code. No project rules specifying versions.

**Fix:**

```yaml
# .cursor/rules/stack-versions.mdc
---
description: "Tech stack version pinning"
globs: ""
alwaysApply: true
---
# Stack Versions (ALWAYS use these)
- React 19 with Server Components (NOT class components)
- Next.js 15 App Router (NOT Pages Router)
- TypeScript 5.7 strict mode
- Prisma 6 (NOT Sequelize or TypeORM)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (NOT styled-components)
- Node.js 22 (ESM, NOT CommonJS require())
```

### AI Generates Code That Doesn't Match Your Patterns

**Symptom:** Generated code uses different naming, structure, or patterns than your codebase.

**Root cause:** AI does not have your existing code as context.

**Fix:** Reference your existing patterns explicitly:

```
@src/api/users/route.ts

Create src/api/products/route.ts following the EXACT same patterns:
same error handling, same response format, same validation approach.
```

### AI Hallucinates Non-Existent Functions

**Symptom:** AI calls functions or uses imports that do not exist in your project or in the library.

**Root cause:** Model confuses similar libraries or invents plausible-sounding APIs.

**Fix:**

1. Add `@Docs` context: `@Docs Prisma` gives the AI real API documentation
2. Verify generated imports: run `npm run build` immediately after applying
3. Use `@Files` to show the actual module interface: `@src/lib/database.ts`

### AI Ignores Your Instructions

**Symptom:** You ask for one thing, AI does something different.

**Root cause:** Context window overflow -- your instructions get pushed out by file contents.

**Fix:**

1. Start a **new chat** (Cmd+N) -- conversation history may be using too much context
2. Use fewer `@` references -- each consumes context budget
3. Put instructions at the **end** of the prompt (models attend more to recent text)
4. Use `@Files` instead of `@Codebase` to reduce context volume

### Tab Completion is Repetitive or Wrong

**Symptom:** Tab keeps suggesting the same wrong pattern.

**Root cause:** Tab has limited context compared to Chat/Composer.

**Fix:**

1. Open related files in editor tabs (Tab reads open tabs)
2. Add a comment above your cursor describing what you want
3. Reject bad suggestions with `Esc` (trains the model)
4. If persistently wrong, use Cmd+K inline edit instead

## Systematic Debug Workflow

When AI output is consistently wrong:

```
Step 1: Check context
  - Open Chat, look at context pills at top
  - Are the right files included?
  - Are stale files adding noise?

Step 2: Check rules
  - @Cursor Rules in chat -- what rules are active?
  - Do rules conflict with each other?
  - Are glob patterns matching the right files?

Step 3: Test with minimal context
  - Start new chat
  - Add ONLY the most relevant file: @src/the-file.ts
  - Ask your question with explicit constraints
  - If this works, the issue was context pollution

Step 4: Test with different model
  - Switch from Sonnet to Opus or GPT-5
  - If better model gives better results, the task needs more reasoning power

Step 5: Check indexing
  - Is the codebase indexed? (status bar shows "Indexed")
  - Is the relevant file excluded by .cursorignore?
  - Run Cmd+Shift+P > "Cursor: Resync Index"
```

## Logs and Diagnostics

### Opening Developer Tools

`Cmd+Shift+P` > `Developer: Toggle Developer Tools`

Check the Console tab for:

- API request errors (red)
- Context assembly logs
- Extension errors

### Verbose Logging

Enable verbose output: `Cursor Settings` > search "log level" > set to "Debug"

Logs location:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/logs/`
- Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/logs/`

### Reproducing Issues for Bug Reports

```
1. Note Cursor version: Help > About
2. Note model used (from Chat/Composer header)
3. Copy the exact prompt that produced wrong output
4. Copy the wrong output
5. List active extensions: Cmd+Shift+P > "Extensions: Show Installed"
6. Note if Privacy Mode is on (affects model behavior)
7. Report at forum.cursor.com or github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues
```

## Enterprise Considerations

- **Quality baselines**: Track AI suggestion accuracy over time per team/project
- **Model pinning**: If a model update degrades quality, temporarily switch to a different model while reporting
- **Rule audits**: Periodically review `.cursor/rules/` for outdated or conflicting rules
- **Training**: Ensure team knows the difference between context, model, and prompt issues
