# Cursor Team Setup

Configure Cursor for teams and organizations. Covers plan selection, member management, shared configurations, Privacy Mode enforcement, and onboarding workflows.

## Plan Comparison

| Feature | Pro ($20/user/mo) | Business ($40/user/mo) | Enterprise (custom) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Fast requests | 500/mo | 500/mo/seat | Custom |
| Tab completion | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Privacy Mode | Optional | Enforced by default | Enforced |
| SSO (SAML/OIDC) | No | Yes | Yes |
| SCIM provisioning | No | No | Yes |
| Admin dashboard | No | Yes | Yes |
| Usage analytics | No | Yes | Yes (advanced) |
| Priority support | No | No | Yes |
| Dedicated account mgr | No | No | Yes |
| SLA | No | No | Yes |
| SOC 2 report access | No | Request | Included |

## Team Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Create Organization

1. Go to [cursor.com/settings](https://cursor.com/settings)
2. Click "Create Team" or "Create Organization"
3. Enter organization name and billing details
4. Select plan (Business or Enterprise)

### Step 2: Configure Team Settings

**Admin Dashboard** (Business/Enterprise):

```
Dashboard Sections:
├── Members         → Invite, remove, assign roles
├── Usage           → Request counts, model usage, costs
├── Privacy         → Privacy Mode enforcement
├── Models          → Restrict available models
├── SSO             → SAML/OIDC configuration
└── Billing         → Plan, invoices, seat management
```

### Step 3: Invite Members

```
Methods:
1. Email invitation: Admin dashboard > Members > Invite by email
2. Domain auto-join: Allow anyone with @company.com to join
3. SSO provisioning: Users auto-join when they sign in via SSO
4. SCIM (Enterprise): Automatic sync from identity provider
```

**Roles:**

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Owner | Full admin, billing, delete org |
| Admin | Manage members, settings, SSO |
| Member | Use Cursor with team settings |

### Step 4: Enforce Privacy Mode

For Business and Enterprise plans:

1. Admin Dashboard > Privacy
2. Enable "Enforce Privacy Mode for all members"
3. Team members cannot disable Privacy Mode locally
4. Verification: each client pings server every 5 minutes to check enforcement

Privacy Mode guarantees:

- Zero data retention at model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- No code used for model training
- No plaintext code stored on Cursor servers

### Step 5: Configure Model Access

Admin Dashboard > Models:

```
Available models (toggle on/off per team):
  ✅ GPT-4o
  ✅ Claude Sonnet
  ✅ Auto mode
  ❌ Claude Opus (restricted to save costs)
  ❌ o1 (restricted to save costs)
  ✅ cursor-small
```

Restricting models helps control costs -- premium models consume fast requests faster.

## Shared Configuration (via Git)

Team settings that belong in the project repository:

### Project Rules

```
.cursor/rules/
├── project.mdc            # Stack, conventions (alwaysApply: true)
├── security.mdc           # Security constraints (alwaysApply: true)
├── code-style.mdc         # Naming, formatting (alwaysApply: true)
├── typescript.mdc         # TS patterns (glob: **/*.ts)
├── react.mdc              # React patterns (glob: **/*.tsx)
└── testing.mdc            # Test conventions (glob: **/*.test.ts)
```

Commit these to git. Every team member gets the same AI behavior.

### Ignore Files

```
.cursorignore              # Shared exclusions (commit to git)
.cursorindexingignore      # Shared indexing exclusions (commit to git)
```

### Machine-Local Settings

These are NOT shared via git:

- `settings.json` (editor preferences -- personal choice)
- `keybindings.json` (keyboard shortcuts -- personal choice)
- API keys (stored in Cursor's local settings database)

## Onboarding New Team Members

### Onboarding Checklist

```markdown
## New Team Member: Cursor Setup (20 minutes)

### Account
[ ] Download Cursor from cursor.com/download
[ ] Sign in with @company.com email
[ ] Verify Business plan active (cursor.com/settings)
[ ] Verify Privacy Mode is ON (Cursor Settings > General)

### Project Setup
[ ] Clone the repository
[ ] Open in Cursor: `cursor /path/to/project`
[ ] Wait for indexing to complete (bottom status bar)
[ ] Verify rules loaded: Cmd+L > type "@Cursor Rules"

### Learn the Basics (10 min)
[ ] Tab completion: type code, accept with Tab
[ ] Chat: Cmd+L > "@Codebase how is auth handled?"
[ ] Inline Edit: select code > Cmd+K > "add error handling"
[ ] Composer: Cmd+I > describe a multi-file task

### Team Conventions
[ ] Read .cursor/rules/ files (our AI guidelines)
[ ] Use Conventional Commits for commit messages
[ ] Start new chats for new tasks (don't reuse old conversations)
[ ] Review all AI-generated code before committing
```

### Buddy System

Pair new team members with experienced Cursor users for their first week. Focus areas:

- When to use Chat vs Composer vs Inline Edit
- How to write effective prompts with `@` context
- Common pitfalls (context overflow, blind apply)
- Team-specific rules and conventions

## Usage Monitoring

### Admin Dashboard Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Requests per user | Identify power users and underutilizers |
| Model distribution | Which models are used most |
| Fast vs slow requests | Quota consumption rate |
| Cost per seat | ROI calculation |

### Adoption Indicators

```
High adoption:
  - 80%+ team members active weekly
  - Average 10+ requests/day per user
  - Rules files regularly updated in git

Low adoption (needs attention):
  - Team members not signing in
  - Rules files stale or absent
  - No AI commit messages in git history
```

## Enterprise Considerations

- **SCIM provisioning**: Sync users and groups from Okta/Azure AD automatically (Enterprise only)
- **Audit logging**: Enterprise plans include detailed usage audit logs for compliance
- **Cost allocation**: Track AI costs per team/project for internal chargeback
- **Vendor review**: Request Cursor's SOC 2 Type II report and security questionnaire for procurement
