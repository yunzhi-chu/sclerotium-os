description: 'Optimize CoreWeave GPU cloud costs with right-sizing and scheduling.

  Use when reducing GPU spend, selecting cost-effective instances,

  or implementing scale-to-zero for dev workloads.

  Trigger with phrases like "coreweave cost", "coreweave pricing",

  "reduce coreweave spend", "coreweave budget".

# CoreWeave Cost Tuning

## GPU Pricing Reference (approximate)

| GPU | Per GPU/hour | Best For |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| A100 40GB PCIe | ~$1.50 | Development, smaller models |
| A100 80GB PCIe | ~$2.21 | Production inference |
| H100 80GB PCIe | ~$4.76 | High-throughput inference |
| H100 SXM5 (8x) | ~$6.15/GPU | Training, multi-GPU |
| L40 | ~$1.10 | Image generation, light inference |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Scale-to-Zero for Dev/Staging

```yaml
autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "0"
autoscaling.knative.dev/scaleDownDelay: "5m"
```

### Right-Size GPU Selection

```python
def recommend_gpu(model_size_b: float, inference_only: bool = True) -> str:
    if model_size_b <= 7:
        return "L40" if inference_only else "A100_PCIE_80GB"
    elif model_size_b <= 13:
        return "A100_PCIE_80GB"
    elif model_size_b <= 70:
        return "A100_PCIE_80GB (4x tensor parallel)"
    else:
        return "H100_SXM5 (8x tensor parallel)"
```

### Quantization to Use Smaller GPUs

Use AWQ or GPTQ quantization to fit larger models on smaller GPUs:

```bash
# 70B model at 4-bit fits on single A100-80GB instead of 4x
vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-AWQ --quantization awq
```
