# Fathom Hello World

## Overview

First API calls against Fathom: list meetings, get a transcript, retrieve AI-generated summaries and action items.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `fathom-install-auth` setup
- At least one recorded meeting in Fathom

## Instructions

### Step 1: List Meetings

```bash
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: ${FATHOM_API_KEY}" \
  "https://api.fathom.ai/external/v1/meetings?limit=5" \
  | jq '.meetings[] | {id, title, created_at, duration_seconds}'
```

### Step 2: Get Meeting Transcript

```bash
RECORDING_ID="your-recording-id"

curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: ${FATHOM_API_KEY}" \
  "https://api.fathom.ai/external/v1/recordings/${RECORDING_ID}/transcript" \
  | jq '.segments[] | {speaker, text, start_time}'
```

### Step 3: Get AI Summary and Action Items

```bash
# Get meeting with summary included
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: ${FATHOM_API_KEY}" \
  "https://api.fathom.ai/external/v1/meetings?include_summary=true&limit=1" \
  | jq '.meetings[0] | {title, summary, action_items}'
```

### Step 4: Filter Meetings by Date

```bash
# Meetings from the last 7 days
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: ${FATHOM_API_KEY}" \
  "https://api.fathom.ai/external/v1/meetings?created_after=2026-03-15T00:00:00Z&limit=20" \
  | jq '.meetings | length'
```

## Output

- List of meetings with IDs and metadata
- Full transcript with speaker labels and timestamps
- AI-generated summary and action items

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Empty meetings array | No recordings in account | Record a meeting in Fathom |
| `404` on recording ID | Wrong ID or deleted | List meetings to get valid IDs |
| No summary available | Meeting still processing | Wait a few minutes after recording |
| Transcript empty | Recording too short | Minimum meeting length required |
