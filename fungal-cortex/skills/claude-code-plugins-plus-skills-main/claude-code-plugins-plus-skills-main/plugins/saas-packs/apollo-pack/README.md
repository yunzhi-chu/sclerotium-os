# Apollo Skill Pack

> Claude Code skill pack for Apollo.io sales intelligence platform (24 skills)

Apollo.io is a B2B sales intelligence and engagement platform with 275M+ contacts, lead search, enrichment, email sequences, and deal management. This pack provides production-ready skills for every stage of Apollo API integration — from first API call to enterprise deployment.

## One-Pager

### The Problem

Apollo.io has no official SDK. The REST API uses non-obvious conventions — `x-api-key` headers (not query params), separate search endpoints that changed names (`/mixed_people/api_search`), a master vs standard key distinction, and a credit model where search is free but enrichment costs money. Teams waste days learning these details.

### The Solution

24 skills covering the full Apollo integration lifecycle with correct endpoints, real code, and production patterns. Every skill uses the actual API (`https://api.apollo.io/api/v1/`), real authentication (`x-api-key` header), and real response shapes from Apollo's documentation.

| What | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Who** | Developers integrating Apollo.io into sales tools, CRMs, and data pipelines |
| **What** | 24 Claude Code skills: 12 standard, 6 pro, 6 flagship |
| **Where** | Any Node.js/TypeScript or Python project using Apollo's REST API |
| **When** | During development, CI/CD setup, production deployment, or incident response |
| **Why** | Eliminate trial-and-error with Apollo's undocumented patterns |

| Stack | |
|-------|---|
| API | Apollo.io REST API v1 (`api.apollo.io/api/v1`) |
| Auth | `x-api-key` header (master + standard key types) |
| Languages | TypeScript, Python |
| Testing | Vitest + MSW mocks, sandbox tokens |
| Infra | GCP Cloud Run, Vercel, Kubernetes |

### Key Differentiators

- **Correct endpoints**: Uses `/mixed_people/api_search` (not the deprecated `/people/search`), `/people/bulk_match`, `/emailer_campaigns/search`
- **Credit-aware**: Every skill notes which operations cost credits and which are free
- **Master vs standard keys**: Skills flag which endpoints require master API keys
- **Real error handling**: Covers the actual HTTP codes Apollo returns (401 for bad key, 403 for wrong key type, 429 with rate limit details)
