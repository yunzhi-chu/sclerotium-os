# Hex Common Errors

## Error Reference

### 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Token invalid, expired, or missing.
**Fix:** Regenerate token in Hex workspace settings.

### 403 Forbidden — Read-Only Token

**Cause:** Token has "Read projects" scope but RunProject requires "Run projects".
**Fix:** Create new token with "Run projects" scope.

### 404 Not Found — Project

**Cause:** Project ID wrong or project not published.
**Fix:** Verify project ID. Only published projects can be run via API.

### 429 Too Many Requests

**Cause:** RunProject is limited to 20 requests/min, 60/hr.
**Fix:** Queue runs with delays. See `hex-rate-limits`.

### Run Status: ERRORED

**Cause:** SQL query, Python code, or connection error in the project.
**Fix:** Open the project in Hex UI and check the error in the run history.

### Run Status: KILLED

**Cause:** Run exceeded timeout or was manually cancelled.
**Fix:** Optimize slow queries. Increase timeout in API trigger.

## Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Test token
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HEX_API_TOKEN" \
  https://app.hex.tech/api/v1/projects

# List recent runs for a project
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $HEX_API_TOKEN" \
  https://app.hex.tech/api/v1/project/PROJECT_ID/runs | python3 -m json.tool
```
