# Clay Incident Runbook

## Overview

Rapid response procedures for Clay-related production incidents. Clay is a hosted SaaS platform, so incidents fall into two categories: (1) Clay-side issues (platform outage, provider degradation) and (2) your-side issues (webhook misconfiguration, credit exhaustion, handler failures).

## Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------|
| P1 | Complete data flow stopped | < 15 min | Credits exhausted, webhook URL expired, Clay outage |
| P2 | Degraded enrichment | < 1 hour | Low hit rates, slow processing, CRM sync errors |
| P3 | Minor impact | < 4 hours | Single provider down, intermittent webhook failures |
| P4 | No user impact | Next business day | Monitoring gaps, cost optimization needed |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Quick Triage (2 Minutes)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# clay-triage.sh — rapid diagnostic for Clay incidents
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== Clay Incident Triage ==="
echo "Time: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
echo ""

# 1. Check Clay platform status
echo "--- Clay Platform Status ---"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "clay.com: HTTP %{http_code}\n" https://www.clay.com
echo ""

# 2. Test webhook delivery
echo "--- Webhook Test ---"
if [ -n "${CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL:-}" ]; then
  WEBHOOK_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    -X POST "$CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"_triage": true, "_ts": "'$(date -u +%s)'"}')
  echo "Webhook: HTTP $WEBHOOK_CODE"
  if [ "$WEBHOOK_CODE" = "200" ]; then echo "  -> Webhook OK"; fi
  if [ "$WEBHOOK_CODE" = "404" ]; then echo "  -> ISSUE: Webhook URL invalid/expired"; fi
  if [ "$WEBHOOK_CODE" = "429" ]; then echo "  -> ISSUE: Rate limited"; fi
else
  echo "CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL not set!"
fi
echo ""

# 3. Test Enterprise API (if applicable)
echo "--- Enterprise API Test ---"
if [ -n "${CLAY_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
  API_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    -X POST "https://api.clay.com/v1/people/enrich" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAY_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email": "triage@test.com"}')
  echo "Enterprise API: HTTP $API_CODE"
  if [ "$API_CODE" = "401" ]; then echo "  -> ISSUE: API key invalid/expired"; fi
  if [ "$API_CODE" = "403" ]; then echo "  -> ISSUE: Not on Enterprise plan or key revoked"; fi
else
  echo "No Enterprise API key configured"
fi
echo ""

# 4. Check your callback endpoint
echo "--- Callback Endpoint ---"
CALLBACK_URL="${CLAY_CALLBACK_URL:-https://your-app.com/api/health}"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Callback: HTTP %{http_code}\n" "$CALLBACK_URL" || echo "Callback endpoint unreachable!"
```

### Step 2: Decision Tree

```
Enrichment not running?
├── Check Clay UI: any red error cells?
│   ├── YES: Click cells, read error messages → go to Error Resolution
│   └── NO: Continue
├── Is auto-run enabled? (Table Settings > Auto-update)
│   ├── NO: Enable auto-update at table level, then column level
│   └── YES: Continue
├── Do you have credits remaining? (Settings > Plans & Billing)
│   ├── NO: Add credits or connect own provider API keys → P1
│   └── YES: Continue
├── Is the webhook accepting data? (Test with curl)
│   ├── NO: Re-create webhook (50K limit may be hit) → P1
│   └── YES: The issue is likely provider-side
└── Check individual enrichment providers in Clay Settings > Connections
    ├── Provider connection lost → Reconnect API key
    └── Provider rate limited → Wait or switch to different provider
```

### Step 3: Common Incident Resolutions

**P1: Credits Exhausted**

```
1. Check: Settings > Plans & Billing > Credit balance
2. Immediate: Connect your own provider API keys (0 credits)
3. Short-term: Add credit pack or upgrade plan
4. Prevent: Set credit burn alerts (see clay-observability)
```

**P1: Webhook URL Expired (50K Limit)**

```
1. Check: Table > + Add > Webhooks — does existing webhook show "limit reached"?
2. Fix: Create new webhook on same table
3. Update: Change CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL in all deployment secrets
4. Verify: Send test payload to new webhook URL
```

**P2: Low Enrichment Hit Rate**

```
1. Check: Sample 10 rows — are input domains valid?
2. Check: Are providers connected? (Settings > Connections)
3. Fix: Pre-filter invalid rows, reconnect providers
4. Monitor: Track hit rate for next hour
```

**P2: CRM Sync Failures**

```
1. Check: HTTP API column errors (click red cells)
2. Common: CRM API key expired → regenerate and update in column config
3. Common: Field mapping changed → update column body JSON
4. Test: Run HTTP API column on single row manually
```

### Step 4: Communication Template

```markdown
## Clay Incident Notification

**Severity:** P[1/2/3]
**Time detected:** [UTC timestamp]
**Impact:** [What's not working]
**Affected:** [Teams/workflows affected]

**Current Status:** [Investigating / Mitigating / Resolved]

**Actions Taken:**
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

**Next Update:** [Time]

**Root Cause:** [If known]
**Resolution:** [Steps taken to fix]
**Prevention:** [What we'll do to prevent recurrence]
```

### Step 5: Postmortem Template

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Incident Date | [Date] |
| Duration | [X hours] |
| Severity | P[1/2/3] |
| Impact | [Leads not enriched / CRM not updated / Credits exhausted] |
| Root Cause | [e.g., Webhook hit 50K limit without monitoring] |
| Detection | [How was it discovered? Alert / user report / manual check] |
| Resolution | [Steps taken] |
| Credits Lost | [Estimate of wasted credits, if any] |
| Prevention | [Monitoring gaps to close, safeguards to add] |

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Can't access Clay dashboard | Browser/network issue | Try incognito, different browser, or mobile |
| Webhook test returns nothing | Webhook URL malformed | Re-copy full URL from Clay table |
| All providers returning empty | Account-level issue | Contact Clay support at community.clay.com |
| CRM pushing wrong data | Column references changed | Re-map HTTP API column body fields |
