# Clay Install & Auth

## Overview

Clay is a web-based data enrichment platform — there is no SDK to install. Integration happens through webhook URLs (inbound data), HTTP API enrichment columns (outbound calls from Clay), and the Enterprise API (programmatic people/company lookups). This skill covers account setup, API key management, provider connections, and webhook configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Clay account at [clay.com](https://www.clay.com) (free tier available)
- For Enterprise API: Enterprise plan subscription
- For webhook integration: HTTPS endpoint or tunneling tool (ngrok)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Clay API Key (Enterprise Only)

Navigate to **Settings > API** in your Clay workspace. Copy your API key. Clay's Enterprise API is limited to people and company data lookups — it is not a general-purpose table API.

```bash
# Store your Clay API key securely
export CLAY_API_KEY="clay_ent_your_api_key_here"

# Verify with a test lookup (Enterprise API)
curl -s -X POST "https://api.clay.com/v1/people/enrich" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}' | jq .
```

### Step 2: Configure Webhook Inbound Source

Every Clay table can receive data via a unique webhook URL. This is the primary way to send data into Clay programmatically.

1. Open a Clay workbook (or create one)
2. Click **+ Add** at the bottom of the table
3. Search for **Webhooks** and click **Monitor webhook**
4. Copy the generated webhook URL

```bash
# Store your table's webhook URL
export CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL="https://app.clay.com/api/v1/webhooks/your-unique-id"

# Send a test record to your Clay table
curl -X POST "$CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "jane@acme.com",
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "title": "VP of Sales"
  }'
```

The record appears as a new row in your Clay table within seconds.

### Step 3: Connect Data Provider API Keys

Clay supports 150+ enrichment providers. Connecting your own API keys saves 70-80% on Clay credits.

1. Go to **Settings > Connections** in Clay
2. Click **Add Connection** for each provider
3. Paste your API key

**Common providers to connect:**

| Provider | Key Location | Credit Savings |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Apollo.io | Settings > API Keys | 2 credits/lookup saved |
| Clearbit | Dashboard > API | 2-5 credits saved |
| People Data Labs | Dashboard > API Keys | 3 credits saved |
| Hunter.io | Dashboard > API | 2 credits saved |
| ZoomInfo | Admin > API | 5-13 credits saved |
| Prospeo | Dashboard > API Key | 2 credits saved |

When you use your own API keys, **0 Clay credits** are consumed — credits only apply when using Clay's managed provider accounts.

### Step 4: Create .env for Local Integration Code

```bash
# .env — for local scripts that interact with Clay
CLAY_API_KEY=clay_ent_your_key          # Enterprise API (if applicable)
CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://app.clay.com/api/v1/webhooks/abc123  # Table webhook
CLAY_WORKSPACE_ID=ws_your_workspace     # Found in Settings > Workspace

# Provider keys (optional — for direct provider calls outside Clay)
APOLLO_API_KEY=your_apollo_key
CLEARBIT_API_KEY=your_clearbit_key
HUNTER_API_KEY=your_hunter_key
```

### Step 5: Verify Webhook Authentication

Secure your webhook endpoint with a shared secret in the header:

```bash
# Send authenticated webhook data
curl -X POST "$CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Secret: your-shared-secret" \
  -d '{"email": "test@acme.com", "source": "auth-verification"}'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or expired API key | Regenerate key in Settings > API |
| `403 Forbidden` | Feature not on your plan | Enterprise API requires Enterprise plan |
| `422 Unprocessable` | Malformed webhook payload | Ensure valid JSON with Content-Type header |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Explorer plan: 400 records/hour | Throttle webhook submissions or upgrade |
| Webhook URL expired | Table deleted or webhook limit hit | Create new webhook (50K submission limit per webhook) |
| Provider connection failed | Invalid third-party API key | Verify key in provider's own dashboard |

## Output

- Clay workspace configured with API access
- Webhook URL ready to receive programmatic data
- Provider API keys connected for credit savings
- `.env` file with all required credentials
