# Anthropic Enterprise & Access Management

## Overview

Anthropic uses **Organizations** and **Workspaces** for access control. API keys are scoped to workspaces.

## Organization Structure

```
Organization (your-company)
├── Workspace: Production
│   ├── API Key: prod-backend (Tier 4)
│   └── API Key: prod-frontend-proxy (Tier 2)
├── Workspace: Staging
│   └── API Key: staging-all (Tier 2)
└── Workspace: Development
    └── API Key: dev-team (Tier 1)
```

## API Key Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| One key per service/environment | Isolate blast radius |
| Name keys descriptively | `prod-recommendation-service` not `key-1` |
| Set spending limits per key | Prevent runaway costs from bugs |
| Rotate quarterly | Reduce exposure window |
| Never share dev and prod keys | Different rate limit tiers |

## Spending Limits

Set in Anthropic Console → Settings → Limits:

- **Monthly spend limit**: Hard cap on total spend
- **Per-key limits**: Not yet available — use separate workspaces

## Access Control Checklist

- [ ] Separate workspaces for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Separate API keys per service
- [ ] Spending alerts configured
- [ ] Key rotation schedule (90 days)
- [ ] Offboarding process: revoke keys when team members leave
- [ ] Audit log review (Console → Logs)

## Output

- Separate workspaces for production, staging, and development
- Dedicated API keys per service/environment with descriptive names
- Spending limits and alerts configured
- Key rotation schedule established (90-day cycle)
- Access control checklist completed

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| API Error | Check error type and status code | See `clade-common-errors` |

## Examples

See Organization Structure diagram, API Key Best Practices table, and Access Control Checklist above.
