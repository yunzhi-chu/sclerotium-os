# Lucidchart Cost Tuning

## Overview

Lucidchart pricing is per-seat with costs driven by document export volume and real-time collaboration event frequency. Each diagram export (PNG, PDF, SVG), embedded preview refresh, and collaborative editing session generates API activity. Organizations with large teams producing architectural diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes at scale accumulate significant costs from redundant exports of unchanged diagrams and excessive collaboration event polling. Caching exports, batching operations, and right-sizing seat allocation are the primary optimization levers.

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Cost Driver | Optimization |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Seat licenses | Per-user/month (Individual $7.95, Team $9, Enterprise custom) | Audit active editors; move view-only users to free tier |
| Document exports | Per-export for PNG/PDF/SVG generation | Cache exported images; re-export only on document change |
| Collaboration events | Real-time sync events during editing | Debounce polling; aggregate change events |
| Embedded previews | API calls for diagram embeds in other tools | Cache embedded image URLs with 1-hour TTL |
| Template operations | Creating/cloning from template library | Clone once locally; avoid repeated API template fetches |

## API Call Reduction

```typescript
class LucidchartExportCache {
  private exportCache = new Map<string, { url: string; docVersion: number; expiry: number }>();

  async getExport(docId: string, currentVersion: number, exportFn: () => Promise<string>): Promise<string> {
    const cached = this.exportCache.get(docId);
    if (cached && cached.docVersion === currentVersion && Date.now() < cached.expiry) {
      return cached.url; // Diagram unchanged — serve cached export
    }
    const url = await exportFn();
    this.exportCache.set(docId, {
      url,
      docVersion: currentVersion,
      expiry: Date.now() + 3_600_000 // 1-hour TTL
    });
    return url;
  }

  async batchExport(docs: Array<{ id: string; version: number }>, exportFn: (id: string) => Promise<string>): Promise<Map<string, string>> {
    const results = new Map<string, string>();
    for (const doc of docs) {
      const cached = this.exportCache.get(doc.id);
      if (cached && cached.docVersion === doc.version) {
        results.set(doc.id, cached.url);
      } else {
        results.set(doc.id, await exportFn(doc.id));
      }
    }
    return results;
  }
}
```

## Usage Monitoring

```typescript
class LucidchartCostMonitor {
  private daily = { exports: 0, collabEvents: 0, embeds: 0 };
  private budgets = { exports: 500, collabEvents: 10_000, embeds: 2000 };

  record(type: 'exports' | 'collabEvents' | 'embeds'): void {
    this.daily[type]++;
    const pct = (this.daily[type] / this.budgets[type]) * 100;
    if (pct > 80) {
      console.warn(`Lucidchart ${type} at ${pct.toFixed(0)}%: ${this.daily[type]}/${this.budgets[type]}`);
    }
  }

  resetDaily(): void { this.daily = { exports: 0, collabEvents: 0, embeds: 0 }; }
}
```

## Cost Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Cache diagram exports keyed by document version
- [ ] Re-export only when document version changes
- [ ] Move view-only users from paid to free tier
- [ ] Debounce collaboration event polling to 5-second intervals
- [ ] Cache embedded diagram preview URLs with 1-hour TTL
- [ ] Batch export operations instead of per-document calls
- [ ] Set daily export budget alerts at 80% threshold
- [ ] Clone templates locally to avoid repeated API fetches

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Export costs spiking | Re-exporting unchanged diagrams on every page load | Version-check before export; serve cached image |
| Collaboration event floods | Polling collab status every second | Debounce to 5-second intervals; use websocket if available |
| Stale embedded previews | Cache TTL too long after diagram update | Invalidate embed cache on document save event |
| Seat costs exceeding budget | Inactive users on paid editor tier | Quarterly seat audit; deprovision after 60 days inactive |
| Rate limit on batch exports | Exporting entire workspace at once | Throttle to 10 concurrent exports with queue |
