# Speak Upgrade & Migration

## Overview

Upgrade Speak SDK versions, migrate between language learning platforms, and handle API version changes.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `speak-install-auth` setup
- Valid API credentials configured
- Understanding of Speak API patterns

## Instructions

## Current State

!`npm list @speak/language-sdk 2>/dev/null || echo 'Speak SDK not installed'`

### Step 1: Check Current Version

```bash
npm list @speak/language-sdk
npm outdated @speak/language-sdk
```

### Step 2: Upgrade SDK

```bash
npm install @speak/language-sdk@latest
npm test  # Run tests to verify compatibility
```

### Step 3: API Version Migration

```typescript
// Check for deprecated endpoints
const DEPRECATED_ENDPOINTS = [
  '/v1/lessons/start',      // Replaced by /v1/conversations/start
  '/v1/speech/score',       // Replaced by /v1/pronunciation/assess
];

// Migration map
const ENDPOINT_MIGRATION = {
  '/v1/lessons/start': '/v1/conversations/start',
  '/v1/speech/score': '/v1/pronunciation/assess',
};
```

### Step 4: Platform Migration (from Duolingo/Babbel APIs)

```typescript
// Map learning data between platforms
interface MigrationMapper {
  mapProficiencyLevel(source: string): 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  mapLanguageCode(source: string): string;
  mapProgress(source: any): SpeakProgress;
}

const duolingoMapper: MigrationMapper = {
  mapProficiencyLevel(crowns: string) {
    const c = parseInt(crowns);
    if (c < 3) return 'beginner';
    if (c < 6) return 'intermediate';
    return 'advanced';
  },
  mapLanguageCode: (code) => code, // Same ISO codes
  mapProgress: (duo) => ({
    vocabulary: duo.words_learned,
    level: duolingoMapper.mapProficiencyLevel(duo.crowns),
  }),
};
```

### Post-Upgrade Verification

```bash
npm test
node -e "const s = require('@speak/language-sdk'); console.log('SDK version:', s.version || 'loaded OK')"
```

## Output

- Migration implementation complete
- Speak API integration verified
- Production-ready patterns applied

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Verify SPEAK_API_KEY environment variable |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Wait Retry-After seconds, use backoff |
| Audio format error | Wrong codec/sample rate | Convert to WAV 16kHz mono with ffmpeg |
| Session expired | Timeout after 30 min | Start a new conversation session |

## Next Steps

See `speak-prod-checklist` for production readiness.

## Examples

**Basic**: Apply upgrade migration with default configuration for a standard Speak integration.

**Advanced**: Customize for production with error recovery, monitoring, and team-specific requirements.
