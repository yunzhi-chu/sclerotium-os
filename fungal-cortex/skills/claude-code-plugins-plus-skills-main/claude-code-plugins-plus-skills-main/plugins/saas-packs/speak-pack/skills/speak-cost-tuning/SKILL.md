# Speak Cost Tuning

## Overview

Optimize Speak API costs through usage monitoring, tier selection, and efficient audio processing.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `speak-install-auth` setup
- Valid API credentials configured
- Understanding of Speak API patterns

## Instructions

### Step 1: Configuration

Configure cost tuning for your Speak integration. Speak uses OpenAI's GPT-4o for AI tutoring and Whisper for speech recognition.

```typescript
// speak_cost_tuning_config.ts
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.SPEAK_API_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.SPEAK_APP_ID!,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
};
```

### Step 2: Implementation

```typescript
// Core implementation for speak cost tuning
import { SpeakClient } from '@speak/language-sdk';

const client = new SpeakClient(config);

// Production-ready implementation
async function setup() {
  const health = await client.health.check();
  console.log("Status:", health.status);
  return health;
}
```

### Step 3: Verification

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPEAK_API_KEY" https://api.speak.com/v1/health | jq .
```

## Output

- Speak Cost Tuning configured and verified
- Production-ready Speak integration
- Error handling and monitoring in place

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Verify SPEAK_API_KEY |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff |
| Connection timeout | Network issue | Check connectivity to api.speak.com |
| Audio format error | Wrong codec | Convert to WAV 16kHz mono |

For production checklist, see `speak-prod-checklist`.

## Examples

**Basic**: Apply cost tuning with default settings for a standard Speak integration.

**Production**: Configure with monitoring, alerting, and team-specific language learning requirements.
