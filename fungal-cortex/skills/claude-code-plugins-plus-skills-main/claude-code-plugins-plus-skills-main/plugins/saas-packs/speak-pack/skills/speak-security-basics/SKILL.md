# Speak Security Basics

## Overview

Security best practices for Speak API keys, audio data privacy, student data protection, and COPPA/FERPA compliance.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `speak-install-auth` setup
- Valid API credentials configured
- ffmpeg installed for audio processing

## Instructions

### API Key Security

```bash
# Never commit API keys
echo '.env' >> .gitignore
echo '.env.local' >> .gitignore

# Use secrets manager in production
export SPEAK_API_KEY="$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id speak/api-key --query SecretString --output text)"
```

### Audio Data Privacy

```typescript
// Speak processes audio on their servers — do NOT store student audio locally
// unless required by your application
class PrivacyAwareClient {
  async assessAndClean(audioPath: string, targetText: string, language: string) {
    try {
      const result = await this.client.assessPronunciation({
        audioPath, targetText, language,
      });
      return result;
    } finally {
      // Delete local audio file after assessment
      fs.unlinkSync(audioPath);
    }
  }
}
```

### Student Data Protection

- Never log student audio recordings
- Redact student names from API logs
- Store assessment scores, not raw audio
- Implement data retention policies (delete after N days)
- COPPA compliance for students under 13: parental consent required
- FERPA compliance for educational institutions: student data agreements

### Security Checklist

- [ ] API keys in secrets manager, not code
- [ ] Audio files deleted after processing
- [ ] Student PII not logged
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all API calls
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Access logs maintained for audit

## Output

- Basics implementation complete
- Speak API integration verified
- Production-ready patterns applied

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Verify SPEAK_API_KEY environment variable |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Wait Retry-After seconds, use backoff |
| Audio format error | Wrong codec/sample rate | Convert to WAV 16kHz mono with ffmpeg |
| Session expired | Timeout after 30 min | Start a new conversation session |

## Next Steps

See `speak-prod-checklist` for production readiness.

## Examples

**Basic**: Apply security basics with default configuration for a standard Speak integration.

**Advanced**: Customize for production with error recovery, monitoring, and team-specific requirements.
