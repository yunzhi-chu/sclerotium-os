# Speak Incident Runbook

## Overview

Incident response for Speak API outages: triage, fallback to offline mode, and recovery procedures.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `speak-install-auth` setup
- Valid API credentials configured
- Understanding of Speak API patterns

## Instructions

### Step 1: Configuration

Configure incident runbook for your Speak integration. Speak uses OpenAI's GPT-4o for AI tutoring and Whisper for speech recognition.

```typescript
// speak_incident_runbook_config.ts
const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.SPEAK_API_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.SPEAK_APP_ID!,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
};
```

### Step 2: Implementation

```typescript
// Core implementation for speak incident runbook
import { SpeakClient } from '@speak/language-sdk';

const client = new SpeakClient(config);

// CI test with mocked responses
async function runCITests() {
  const mockClient = new MockSpeakClient();
  await mockClient.assessPronunciation({ audioPath: "test.wav", targetText: "hello", language: "en" });
  console.log("CI tests passed");
}
```

### Step 3: Verification

```bash
npm test
```

## Output

- Speak Incident Runbook configured and verified
- CI pipeline with mocked Speak API tests
- Error handling and monitoring in place

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Verify SPEAK_API_KEY |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff |
| Connection timeout | Network issue | Check connectivity to api.speak.com |
| Audio format error | Wrong codec | Convert to WAV 16kHz mono |

## Next Steps

For deployment, see `speak-deploy-integration`.

## Examples

**Basic**: Apply incident runbook with default settings for a standard Speak integration.

**Production**: Configure with monitoring, alerting, and team-specific language learning requirements.
