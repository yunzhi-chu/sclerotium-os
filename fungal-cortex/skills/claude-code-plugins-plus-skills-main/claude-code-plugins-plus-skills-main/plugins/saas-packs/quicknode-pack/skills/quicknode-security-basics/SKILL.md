# QuickNode Security Basics

## Overview

Implementation patterns for QuickNode security basics using blockchain RPC endpoints and the QuickNode SDK.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `quicknode-install-auth` setup

## Instructions

### Step 1: Connect to QuickNode

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT);
const block = await provider.getBlockNumber();
console.log(`Connected at block ${block}`);
```

## Output

- QuickNode integration for security basics

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid endpoint token | Verify URL from Dashboard |
| Rate limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff or upgrade plan |
| Method not found | Add-on required | Enable in QuickNode Dashboard |
