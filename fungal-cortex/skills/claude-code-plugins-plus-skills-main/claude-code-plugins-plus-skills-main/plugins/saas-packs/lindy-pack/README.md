# Lindy AI Skill Pack

> 24 enterprise-grade skills for building, integrating, and operating Lindy AI agents — the no-code AI automation platform with 7,000+ integrations.

## What Lindy Is

Lindy AI is a no-code/low-code platform for building AI agents ("Lindies") that automate workflows across email, chat, Slack, phone, and 7,000+ app integrations via Pipedream. Agents consist of four components: **Prompt** (behavioral instructions), **Model** (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini), **Skills** (available actions), and **Exit Conditions** (completion criteria). Agents run on Lindy's managed infrastructure — you integrate via webhook triggers, HTTP Request actions, and optional SDKs.

**Key concepts**: Triggers wake agents (webhook, email, schedule, chat, Slack, calendar, agent delegation). Actions execute tasks (send email, post to Slack, update sheets, HTTP requests, Run Code in Python/JS via E2B sandbox). Conditions route workflows with natural language branching. Multi-agent "Societies of Lindies" enable modular delegation between specialized agents.
