# Lindy Data Handling

## Overview

Lindy agents process data through triggers, LLM calls, actions, knowledge bases,
and memory. Data flows through Lindy's managed infrastructure with AES-256
encryption at rest and in transit. This skill covers data classification, PII
handling, prompt-level data controls, and regulatory compliance.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of data types processed by your agents
- Knowledge of applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
- For HIPAA: Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Lindy (Enterprise plan)

## Lindy Data Architecture

| Component | Data Storage | Retention |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Tasks** | Task inputs, outputs, step data | Visible in dashboard |
| **Memory** | Persistent snippets across tasks | Until manually deleted |
| **Context** | Per-task accumulated context | Task lifetime only |
| **Knowledge Base** | Uploaded files, crawled sites | Until manually removed |
| **Integrations** | OAuth tokens, connection data | Until disconnected |
| **Computer Use** | Browser session, screenshots | 30 days after last use |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Classify Data in Agent Workflows

Map what data each agent processes:

| Data Category | Examples | Handling |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Public** | Product info, FAQs, pricing | No restrictions |
| **Internal** | Sales reports, meeting notes | Limit to authorized agents |
| **Confidential** | Customer emails, CRM data | Access controls + audit |
| **Restricted** | PII, PHI, payment data | Minimize exposure + compliance |

### Step 2: PII Controls in Agent Prompts

Add data handling instructions directly to agent prompts:

```
## Data Handling Rules
- Never include full email addresses in summaries — use "[name]@[domain]"
- Redact phone numbers in logs — show only last 4 digits
- Do not forward customer personal information to Slack channels
- When storing to spreadsheet, omit columns: email, phone, address
- If asked to share customer data externally, decline and escalate
```

### Step 3: Knowledge Base Data Safety

Knowledge base files are searchable by the agent. Control what goes in:

**DO upload**:

- Product documentation
- FAQ articles
- Policy documents
- Public knowledge articles

**DO NOT upload**:

- Customer databases with PII
- Credentials or API keys
- Internal HR documents (unless agent specifically needs them)
- Financial records with account numbers

**Resync considerations**: KB auto-refreshes every 24 hours. If you upload
sensitive content by mistake, remove it AND trigger a manual Resync.

### Step 4: Secure Memory Usage

Agent memories persist across all future tasks. Be deliberate:

```
Safe memory: "Customer prefers email communication over phone"
Safe memory: "Billing questions should escalate to finance@company.com"

Risky memory: "John Smith's SSN is 123-45-6789"  ← NEVER store PII in memory
Risky memory: "API key for Stripe: sk_live_xxxx"  ← NEVER store secrets
```

Add to agent prompt:

```
## Memory Rules
- Never store personally identifiable information (PII) in memory
- Never store credentials, API keys, or passwords in memory
- Memories should contain preferences, patterns, and procedures only
```

### Step 5: Computer Use Data Isolation

If using Computer Use (browser automation):

- Sessions persist for 30 days with saved credentials
- Enable **Incognito mode** for sessions handling sensitive data
- Use **dedicated** (not shared) computer assignments for sensitive agents
- Review screenshots captured during execution for data exposure

### Step 6: Integration Account Isolation

- Authorize dedicated service accounts per agent (not personal accounts)
- Use Gmail with a team alias, not an individual inbox
- Create read-only database credentials where possible
- Revoke access immediately when an agent is decommissioned

### Step 7: Regulatory Compliance

**GDPR (EU Data Protection)**:

- [ ] Document what personal data each agent processes
- [ ] Ensure agents only process data with valid legal basis
- [ ] Implement data subject access/deletion capabilities
- [ ] Agent prompt includes "do not retain personal data beyond task completion"
- [ ] Review Lindy's data processing agreement

**CCPA (California Consumer Privacy)**:

- [ ] Identify agents processing California resident data
- [ ] Ensure opt-out mechanisms exist for data processing
- [ ] Agent prompt prevents selling/sharing personal information

**HIPAA (Healthcare)**:

- [ ] Enterprise plan with BAA in place
- [ ] Agents only access minimum necessary PHI
- [ ] No PHI in agent memory or knowledge base
- [ ] Audit trail enabled for all PHI access
- [ ] Agent prompt includes PHI handling restrictions

### Step 8: Data Retention Management

```
Agent Prompt Addition:
## Data Retention
- Do not reference data from tasks older than 30 days
- Clear task context after each run (do not accumulate indefinitely)
- When updating memory, remove outdated entries
- Summarize customer interactions, do not store verbatim transcripts
```

## Data Handling Checklist

- [ ] Each agent's data classification documented
- [ ] PII handling rules in every agent prompt
- [ ] Knowledge base audited for sensitive content
- [ ] Memory creation restricted (no PII, no secrets)
- [ ] Integration accounts isolated per agent
- [ ] Computer Use sessions set to dedicated + incognito where needed
- [ ] Regulatory compliance requirements mapped
- [ ] BAA in place if handling healthcare data
- [ ] Data retention policy defined and enforced in prompts

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| PII in Slack channel | Agent forwarded customer email | Add "never forward PII to Slack" to prompt |
| Sensitive file in KB | Uploaded by mistake | Remove file + trigger KB resync immediately |
| Memory contains PII | Agent auto-created memory | Delete memory + add "never store PII" to prompt |
| Audit finding | Agent accessing unnecessary data | Remove unused integrations from agent |
