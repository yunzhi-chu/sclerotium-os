# Lindy Security Basics

## Overview

Security practices for Lindy AI agents. Agents are autonomous — they connect to
external services, execute actions, and handle data. Security focuses on: API key
management, webhook authentication, agent permission scoping, integration account
isolation, and connection sharing controls.

## Prerequisites

- Lindy account with API access
- Understanding of which integrations your agents use
- For Enterprise: SSO/SCIM configuration access

## Instructions

### Step 1: API Key Management

```bash
# Store API key in environment variable — never in source code
export LINDY_API_KEY="lnd_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Or use a secret manager
# AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name lindy/api-key \
  --secret-string "$LINDY_API_KEY"

# Google Secret Manager
echo -n "$LINDY_API_KEY" | gcloud secrets create lindy-api-key \
  --data-file=-
```

**Key rotation schedule**:

| Environment | Rotation Period | Method |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Development | 30 days | Manual regeneration |
| Staging | 90 days | Automated via CI |
| Production | 90 days | Secret manager + automated rotation |
| Post-incident | Immediately | Manual regeneration + revoke old key |

### Step 2: Webhook Authentication

Every webhook trigger generates a unique secret key. Verify it on every inbound request:

```typescript
// Webhook signature verification middleware
function verifyLindyWebhook(
  req: express.Request,
  res: express.Response,
  next: express.NextFunction
) {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  const expectedToken = process.env.LINDY_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

  if (!authHeader || authHeader !== `Bearer ${expectedToken}`) {
    console.warn('Rejected unauthorized webhook attempt', {
      ip: req.ip,
      path: req.path,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }

  next();
}

app.post('/lindy/callback', verifyLindyWebhook, (req, res) => {
  // Process verified webhook
  handleWebhook(req.body);
  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

### Step 3: Agent Permission Scoping

Lindy agents access external services through authorized connections. Minimize blast radius:

**Per-agent integration isolation**:

- Authorize a dedicated Gmail account per agent (not your personal inbox)
- Create Slack bot tokens scoped to specific channels
- Use read-only database credentials where possible
- Create separate API keys for each integration

**Connection sharing controls**:

| Sharing Level | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|
| Private (default) | Personal agents, sensitive data |
| Team shared | Team-wide automation agents |
| Workspace shared | Organization-wide utility agents |

### Step 4: Limit Agent Skill Surface Area

Agents with Agent Steps can choose which skills to use. Reduce risk:

- Start with 2-4 focused skills per agent (not the full catalog)
- Avoid giving agents both read AND write access to the same service unless necessary
- Separate "read" agents from "write" agents for critical systems
- Use conditions to gate destructive actions behind human approval

### Step 5: Data Handling in Agents

```
Agent Prompt Security Patterns:

## Data Constraints
- Never include API keys, passwords, or tokens in responses
- Redact email addresses and phone numbers from summaries
- Do not forward customer data to channels outside #support
- If asked to perform an action outside your scope, respond:
  "I cannot perform that action. Please contact an admin."
```

### Step 6: Audit Agent Activity

1. **Task history**: Review agent Tasks tab for unexpected actions
2. **Integration access**: Periodically review which services each agent can access
3. **Credit anomalies**: Sudden credit spikes may indicate misuse or misconfiguration
4. **Connection review**: Remove unused integrations from agents

### Step 7: Enterprise Security Features

Available on Enterprise plan:

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **SSO** | SAML-based single sign-on |
| **SCIM** | Automated user provisioning/deprovisioning |
| **Audit Logs** | Complete activity trail |
| **Role-Based Access** | Owner/Editor/Viewer workspace roles |
| **BAA** | HIPAA Business Associate Agreement |
| **AES-256** | Encryption at rest and in transit |

## Security Checklist

- [ ] API keys stored in environment variables or secret manager
- [ ] `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Webhook secrets generated and verified on every request
- [ ] Each agent uses minimum necessary integrations
- [ ] Separate integration credentials per agent where possible
- [ ] Agent prompts include data handling constraints
- [ ] Regular review of agent task history for anomalies
- [ ] Key rotation schedule defined and followed
- [ ] Enterprise: SSO enabled, SCIM configured

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Agent accesses wrong service | Over-permissioned | Remove unnecessary integrations |
| Unauthorized webhook processed | No auth verification | Add Bearer token verification |
| API key leaked in logs | Key in agent output | Add "never output credentials" to prompt |
| Agent sends data to wrong channel | Shared connection | Use per-agent dedicated connections |
