# Procore Core Workflow B

## Overview

Build a submittal workflow: create submittals, assign reviewers, track approvals, and manage the review cycle.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `procore-core-workflow-a` (RFIs)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Submittal

```python
submittal = requests.post(
    f"{BASE}/projects/{project_id}/submittals",
    headers={**headers, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={
        "submittal": {
            "title": "Concrete mix design — Foundation",
            "specification_section": "03 30 00",
            "description": "Concrete mix design for foundation pour, 4000 PSI.",
            "received_from_id": 33333,  # Subcontractor
            "approver_id": 44444,        # Project engineer
            "due_date": "2026-04-20",
        }
    },
)
submittal_id = submittal.json()["id"]
print(f"Submittal #{submittal.json()['number']} created")
```

### Step 2: Update Submittal Status

```python
# Approve the submittal
requests.patch(
    f"{BASE}/projects/{project_id}/submittals/{submittal_id}",
    headers={**headers, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"submittal": {"status_id": 2}},  # 2 = Approved
)
```

### Step 3: List Submittals with Filters

```python
# Get all pending submittals
pending = requests.get(
    f"{BASE}/projects/{project_id}/submittals",
    headers=headers,
    params={"filters[status_id]": 1},  # 1 = Open/Pending
)
for s in pending.json():
    print(f"  #{s['number']}: {s['title']} — Due: {s['due_date']}")
```

## Output

- Submittals created with specification sections
- Review workflow with approve/reject
- Filtered submittal listing

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `422 Missing approver` | Required field | Set approver_id |
| `403 Cannot approve` | Not the approver | Only assigned approver can approve |
