# Anthropic Skill Pack

> Claude Code skill pack for Anthropic Claude API integration (30 skills)

Build production Claude API integrations with the Messages API, tool use, streaming, Message Batches, prompt caching, and multi-model routing. Real code examples using the official Python (`anthropic`) and TypeScript (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) SDKs.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install anthropic-pack@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

## What You Can Build

- **Chatbots & assistants** with multi-turn conversations and streaming
- **AI agents** with tool use (function calling) and agentic loops
- **Batch processing pipelines** with 50% cost savings via Message Batches API
- **Multi-model routers** that select Haiku/Sonnet/Opus per task complexity
- **Production services** with prompt caching, rate limiting, and observability
