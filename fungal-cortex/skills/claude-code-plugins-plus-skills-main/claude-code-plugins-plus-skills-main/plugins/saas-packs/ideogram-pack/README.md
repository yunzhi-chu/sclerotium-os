# Ideogram Skill Pack

> 24 Claude Code skills for Ideogram AI image generation -- text-to-image, editing, remixing, upscaling, and asset pipelines with real `api.ideogram.ai` endpoints.

Ideogram is an AI image generation API that excels at rendering legible text inside images -- a capability where most image models fail. This skill pack provides production-ready patterns for all six API endpoints: Generate, Edit (Magic Fill), Remix, Upscale, Describe, and Reframe.
