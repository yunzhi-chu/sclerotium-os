# Fondo Core Workflow B: R&D Tax Credits

## Overview

Claim R&D tax credits through Fondo. Startups with US W-2 employees doing qualifying R&D can offset up to $500,000/year in payroll taxes (FICA). Fondo's CPA team prepares the Form 6765 study.

## R&D Credit Calculation

```

  W-2 wages for R&D employees:        $480,000

  Cloud compute (AWS/GCP):             $36,000
  Software tools for R&D:              $12,000
                                       --------
  Total Qualified Research Expenses:   $606,000

Credit Rate (Alternative Simplified):  ~6-8%
Estimated R&D Credit:                  ~$42,000
```
