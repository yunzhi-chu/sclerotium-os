# Fondo Cost Tuning

## Overview

Maximize Fondo ROI: the R&D tax credit alone should exceed the annual Fondo cost for most startups.

## ROI Analysis

```
Fondo TaxPass cost:      ~$4,000-8,000/year (varies by plan)
Average R&D credit:      $21,000/year
Bookkeeping savings:     $12,000-24,000/year (vs. dedicated bookkeeper)
Tax prep savings:         $5,000-10,000/year (vs. separate CPA)
                         ------------------
Net ROI:                 $24,000-47,000/year benefit
```

## Maximize R&D Credits

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Convert key contractors to W-2 employees | W-2 wages qualify at 100% vs 65% for contractors |
| Tag cloud compute (AWS/GCP) to R&D projects | Qualifies as supply expense |
| Document technical uncertainty in projects | Strengthens audit defense |
| Track contractor hours on R&D activities | Maximizes contractor credit |
| Include software tools used for R&D | Figma, GitHub, testing tools qualify |

## Choose the Right Plan

| Your Situation | Recommended Plan |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Pre-revenue, < 10 employees | Bookkeeping only |
| Revenue-generating, any size | TaxPass (includes R&D credits) |
| Series B+, complex structure | Enterprise (dedicated team) |
| Multi-entity or international | Enterprise |

## Cost Reduction Strategies

- Simplify chart of accounts (fewer custom categories = less CPA time)
- Use auto-categorization rules (reduces manual review)
- Connect all tools via OAuth (reduces manual CSV uploads)
- Respond promptly to CPA questions (reduces back-and-forth cost)
