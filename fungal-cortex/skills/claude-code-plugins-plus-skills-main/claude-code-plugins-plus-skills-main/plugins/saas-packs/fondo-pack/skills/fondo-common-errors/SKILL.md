# Fondo Common Errors

## Overview

Quick reference for common Fondo platform issues and their resolutions.

## Integration Sync Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Bank transactions not appearing | Plaid connection expired | Dashboard > Integrations > Re-connect bank |
| Gusto data stale | OAuth token expired (90-day limit) | Re-authorize in Integrations |
| Stripe revenue missing | Webhook not configured | Connect Stripe in Dashboard > Integrations |
| Duplicate transactions | Multiple connections to same bank | Remove duplicate in Integrations |
| Payroll amounts wrong | Mid-period payroll change | Notify Fondo CPA via Dashboard > Messages |

## Categorization Errors

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Software expense marked as Office | Recategorize in Transactions, Fondo learns |
| Contractor marked as Vendor | Ensure 1099 classification matches in payroll |
| Inter-company transfer as Revenue | Mark as Transfer in Transactions |
| R&D expense not flagged | Tag employee/activity as R&D in Dashboard |

## R&D Credit Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Credit is $0 | No qualifying W-2 employees | Hire W-2 (not 1099) for R&D work |
| Credit lower than expected | Activities not properly documented | Schedule call with Fondo CPA team |
| Ineligible (>$5M revenue) | Exceeds startup threshold | Credit still available, just not payroll offset |
| Missing contractor hours | Time tracking not connected | Upload contractor time logs manually |

## Escalation

1. Dashboard > Messages > New Message (response within 1 business day)
