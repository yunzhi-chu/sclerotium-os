# Clerk Upgrade & Migration

## Current State

!`npm list @clerk/nextjs @clerk/clerk-react @clerk/express 2>/dev/null | grep clerk || echo 'No Clerk packages found'`

## Overview

Safely upgrade Clerk SDK versions and handle breaking changes. Covers version checking, upgrade procedures, common migration patterns, and rollback planning.

## Prerequisites

- Current Clerk integration working
- Git repository with clean working state
- Test environment available for validation

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Current Version and Available Updates

```bash
# Check installed version
npm list @clerk/nextjs

# Check latest available
npm view @clerk/nextjs version

# Check all Clerk packages and their versions
npm outdated | grep clerk
```

### Step 2: Review Breaking Changes

```bash
# View changelog for the target version
npx open-cli https://clerk.com/changelog

# Check GitHub releases for migration notes
npx open-cli https://github.com/clerk/javascript/releases
```

Key version milestones to watch for:

- **v5 to v6**: `auth()` became async (must `await auth()`)
- **v5 to v6**: `authMiddleware` renamed to `clerkMiddleware`
- **v5 to v6**: Import paths changed to `@clerk/nextjs/server`

### Step 3: Upgrade Process

```bash
# Create upgrade branch
git checkout -b chore/upgrade-clerk

# Upgrade all Clerk packages together (they must version-match)
npm install @clerk/nextjs@latest @clerk/themes@latest

# If using other Clerk packages:
# npm install @clerk/clerk-react@latest @clerk/express@latest @clerk/backend@latest

# Verify no version mismatches
npm list | grep clerk
```

### Step 4: Handle Common Migration Patterns

**v5 to v6: `auth()` is now async**

```typescript
// BEFORE (v5): auth() was synchronous
// const { userId } = auth()

// AFTER (v6): auth() returns a Promise
const { userId } = await auth()
```

Find all affected files:

```bash
# Search for synchronous auth() calls that need await
grep -rn "const.*= auth()" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "await"
```

**v5 to v6: Middleware migration**

```typescript
// BEFORE (v5):
// import { authMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs'
// export default authMiddleware({ publicRoutes: ['/'] })

// AFTER (v6):
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (!isPublicRoute(req)) {
    await auth.protect()
  }
})
```

**v5 to v6: Import path changes**

```typescript
// BEFORE:
// import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'

// AFTER:
import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
```

Fix import paths across codebase:

```bash
# Find files using old import path
grep -rn "from '@clerk/nextjs'" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "node_modules" | grep -v "/server"
```

### Step 5: Update Type Definitions

```typescript
// If using custom type extensions, update them
// BEFORE:
// declare module '@clerk/nextjs' { ... }

// AFTER:
declare module '@clerk/nextjs/server' {
  interface AuthObject {
    // Custom session claims type
    sessionClaims?: {
      metadata?: {
        role?: string
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Test Upgrade

```bash
# Build to catch type errors
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start dev server and test manually
npm run dev

# Test critical flows:
# 1. Sign in with email/password
# 2. Sign in with OAuth
# 3. Protected route access
# 4. API route authentication
# 5. Webhook endpoint
# 6. Sign out
```

### Step 7: Rollback Plan

```bash
# If upgrade fails, rollback to previous version
git stash  # Save any manual changes

# Install previous version
npm install @clerk/nextjs@5.x.x  # Replace with your previous version

# Or restore from git
git checkout main -- package.json package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify rollback works
npm run build && npm test
```

## Output

- Clerk SDK upgraded to latest version
- Breaking changes migrated (async auth, new middleware, import paths)
- Type definitions updated
- All tests passing
- Rollback procedure documented

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Type errors after upgrade | API signature changes | Add `await` to `auth()`, update imports |
| `authMiddleware is not exported` | Renamed in v6 | Use `clerkMiddleware` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` |
| `auth() returns Promise` | Now async in v6 | Add `await` to all `auth()` calls |
| Import not found | Path changed | Use `@clerk/nextjs/server` for server-side imports |
| Version mismatch | Clerk packages on different versions | Update all `@clerk/*` packages together |

## Examples

### Automated Migration Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/migrate-clerk-v6.sh
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== Clerk v5 to v6 Migration ==="

# 1. Fix auth() calls (add await)
echo "Adding await to auth() calls..."
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "const.*= auth()" 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
  sed -i 's/const \(.*\) = auth()/const \1 = await auth()/g' "$file"
  echo "  Fixed: $file"
done

# 2. Fix import paths
echo "Updating import paths..."
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep -l "from '@clerk/nextjs'" 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
  if grep -q "auth\|currentUser\|clerkClient" "$file"; then
    sed -i "s/from '@clerk\/nextjs'/from '@clerk\/nextjs\/server'/g" "$file"
    echo "  Fixed: $file"
  fi
done

echo "Done. Run 'npm run build' to check for remaining issues."
```
