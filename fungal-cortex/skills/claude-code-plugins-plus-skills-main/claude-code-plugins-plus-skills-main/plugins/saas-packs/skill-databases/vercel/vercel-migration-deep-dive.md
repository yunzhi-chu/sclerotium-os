## Summary

This skill provides a comprehensive guide for major Vercel migrations. It covers migration type assessment (fresh install, competitor, major version, full replatform), pre-migration analysis scripts, the strangler fig pattern for gradual migration, adapter layer implementation for abstraction, batch data migration with error handling, feature flag-controlled traffic shifting, rollback procedures, and post-migration validation. The goal is complete migration with minimal cumulative downtime.
