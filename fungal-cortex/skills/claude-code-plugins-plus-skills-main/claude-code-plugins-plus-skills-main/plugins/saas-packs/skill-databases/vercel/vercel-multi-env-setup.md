## Summary

This skill addresses multi-environment configuration for Vercel. It covers environment strategy (dev/staging/prod with different API keys), configuration file structure with base and override patterns, environment detection logic, secret management for each context (local .env, GitHub Actions, Vault/Secrets Manager), environment isolation guards to prevent dangerous operations in wrong environments, and feature flags per environment. The goal is zero cross-environment configuration incidents.
