## Summary

This skill sets up automated CI/CD pipelines for Vercel integrations using GitHub Actions. It covers workflow configuration for test automation on push/PR, secure secret management with GitHub Secrets, integration test patterns that gracefully skip when API keys aren't available, release workflows triggered by tags, and branch protection rules. The goal is 100% automated testing coverage for all Vercel integration code.
