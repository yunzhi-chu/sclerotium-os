## Summary

This skill covers enterprise-grade access control for Vercel. It defines role types (Admin, Developer, Viewer, Service) with permission mappings, SAML configuration for SSO with IdP group-to-role mapping, OAuth2/OIDC integration patterns, organization management with SSO enforcement and allowed domains, Express.js middleware for permission checking, and comprehensive audit trail logging. The goal is zero unauthorized access with complete visibility.
