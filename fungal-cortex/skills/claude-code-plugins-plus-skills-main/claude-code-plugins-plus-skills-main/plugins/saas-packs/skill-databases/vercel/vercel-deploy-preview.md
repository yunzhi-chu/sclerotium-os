## Summary

This skill implements Vercel's core feature: deploy previews. It enables instant preview deployments for every pull request, allowing teams to test changes in isolated environments before merging. This is the primary workflow for Vercel - every commit generates a unique preview URL that can be shared with stakeholders for testing and feedback before production deployment.
