**Purpose:** Implement webhook handlers for crawl completion notifications and event-driven data processing pipelines.
**Workflow:** Integration skill - enables event-driven architectures for long-running crawl operations.
**Relates to:** Complements firecrawl-crawl-site for async crawls; feeds into firecrawl-batch-processing

## Summary

This skill implements webhook handlers for FireCrawl's event system. It covers configuring webhook endpoints for crawl completion notifications, implementing secure webhook receivers with signature validation, handling different event types (crawl.started, crawl.page, crawl.completed, crawl.failed), and building event-driven data pipelines that process results as they arrive. This enables efficient handling of long-running crawl jobs without polling.
