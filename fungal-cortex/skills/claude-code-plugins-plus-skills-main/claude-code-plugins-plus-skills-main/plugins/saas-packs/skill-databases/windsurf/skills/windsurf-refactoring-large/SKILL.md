# Windsurf Refactoring Large

## Overview

This skill enables large-scale refactoring operations that span hundreds or thousands of files. It provides phased execution with checkpoints, comprehensive rollback capabilities, and AI-assisted planning.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf IDE with Enterprise or Pro subscription
- Active Cascade AI connection
- Git repository with clean working state
- Comprehensive test suite for validation
- Backup strategy for critical code paths
- Team coordination for multi-developer codebases

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Scope**
2. **Create Plan**
3. **Prepare Environment**
4. **Execute with Cascade**
5. **Verify Completion**

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md` for detailed implementation guide.

## Output

- Refactored codebase with all patterns migrated
- Phase completion reports with metrics
- Before/after performance comparison
- Updated documentation and API references
- Archived rollback artifacts (kept 30 days)

## Error Handling

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/errors.md` for comprehensive error handling.

## Examples

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/examples.md` for detailed examples.
