# Grammarly Common Errors

## Error Reference

### 400 Bad Request — Text Too Short

**Cause:** Text has fewer than 30 words.
**Fix:** Ensure minimum 30 words. Pad short texts with context if needed.

### 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Token expired or invalid.
**Fix:** Re-authenticate with client credentials grant.

### 413 Payload Too Large

**Cause:** Text exceeds 100,000 characters or 4 MB.
**Fix:** Split into chunks using paragraph boundaries. See `grammarly-sdk-patterns` for chunking function.

### 429 Too Many Requests

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded.
**Fix:** Implement exponential backoff. See `grammarly-rate-limits`.

### Plagiarism Check Stuck on "pending"

**Cause:** Large document processing or service delay.
**Fix:** Poll every 3-5 seconds, timeout after 90 seconds.

### AI Detection — Inconsistent Scores

**Cause:** Short text produces unreliable results.
**Fix:** AI detection works best on 200+ words. Scores on short text are less reliable.

## Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAMMARLY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://api.grammarly.com/ecosystem/api/v2/scores

# Test with sample text
curl -X POST https://api.grammarly.com/ecosystem/api/v2/scores \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAMMARLY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "This is a test sentence that has more than thirty words so that the API will accept it and return a valid writing score for our diagnostic purposes."}' | python3 -m json.tool
```
