# Kling AI Production Checklist

## Overview

Checklist covering authentication, error handling, cost controls, monitoring, security, and content policy before deploying Kling AI video generation to production.

## Authentication

- [ ] AK/SK stored in secrets manager (not `.env` in repo)
- [ ] JWT auto-refresh with 5-min buffer before 30-min expiry
- [ ] Separate API keys per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Key rotation schedule (quarterly minimum)
- [ ] `Authorization: Bearer <token>` format verified

## Error Handling

- [ ] HTTP 400/401/402/403/429/5xx all handled
- [ ] Exponential backoff with jitter for 429/5xx retries
- [ ] Max retry limit set (3-5, not infinite)
- [ ] `task_status: "failed"` logs `task_status_msg`
- [ ] 30s timeout on all HTTP calls
- [ ] `duration` sent as string `"5"` not integer `5`

## Cost Controls

- [ ] Daily credit budget enforced in code
- [ ] Alert at 80% daily budget consumption
- [ ] `standard` mode used for non-final renders
- [ ] Max poll attempts cap (no infinite loops)
- [ ] Credit estimate before batch submission

```python
# Pre-batch credit check
credits_needed = len(prompts) * 10  # 10 credits per 5s standard
if credits_needed > DAILY_BUDGET:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Batch needs {credits_needed}, budget is {DAILY_BUDGET}")
```

## Task Management

- [ ] All task_ids logged with timestamp
- [ ] Stuck task detection (>10 min in processing)
- [ ] `callback_url` used instead of polling in production
- [ ] Failed tasks queued for retry
- [ ] Video URLs downloaded promptly (Kling CDN URLs expire)

## Content Safety

- [ ] Prompts validated before API submission
- [ ] User-generated prompts sanitized
- [ ] Default negative prompt includes safety terms
- [ ] Content moderation on user-facing apps
- [ ] Policy violation errors handled gracefully

## Security

- [ ] API keys never logged (redacted in debug output)
- [ ] Video URLs treated as temporary (store on own CDN)
- [ ] Webhook endpoints HTTPS-only
- [ ] Rate limiting on your API layer
- [ ] No sensitive data in prompt strings

## Monitoring

- [ ] API latency tracked per endpoint
- [ ] Success/failure rate dashboard
- [ ] Credit consumption metrics
- [ ] Alert on >5% failure rate
- [ ] Structured JSON logs for all API calls

## Performance

- [ ] Connection pooling via `requests.Session()`
- [ ] Concurrent tasks within API tier limit
- [ ] Video downloads async/background
- [ ] Generated videos CDN-cached

```python
# Connection pooling
session = requests.Session()
adapter = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(pool_connections=5, pool_maxsize=10)
session.mount("https://", adapter)
```

## Pre-Launch Smoke Test

```python
from kling_client import KlingClient

c = KlingClient()
result = c.text_to_video("test: blue sky with clouds", duration=5, mode="standard")
assert result["videos"][0]["url"], "No video URL"
print("READY FOR PRODUCTION")
```
