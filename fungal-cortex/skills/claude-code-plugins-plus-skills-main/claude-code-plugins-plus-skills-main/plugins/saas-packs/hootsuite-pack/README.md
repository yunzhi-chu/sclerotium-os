## Key Concepts

- **OAuth 2.0** — authorization code flow with token refresh (tokens expire ~1 hour)
- **API base** — `https://platform.hootsuite.com/v1/`
- **Media upload** — two-step: create upload URL, PUT to S3, wait for READY state
- **Social profiles** — each connected account (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) has a unique ID
