# Instantly CI Integration

## Overview

Set up CI/CD pipelines for Instantly API v2 integrations. Covers GitHub Actions workflows for testing against the Instantly mock server, validating API key scopes, and deploying webhook receivers. Uses the mock server at `` so CI runs don't send real emails or consume production API limits.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Instantly integration code
- `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` secret in GitHub repo settings (for production tests)
- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.10+ in the project

## Instructions

### Step 1: GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/instantly-ci.yml
name: Instantly Integration CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

env:
  INSTANTLY_USE_MOCK: "true"
  INSTANTLY_BASE_URL: "https://developer.instantly.ai/_mock/api/v2"

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"

      - run: npm ci

      - name: Type check
        run: npx tsc --noEmit

      - name: Lint
        run: npx eslint src/ --ext .ts

      - name: Unit tests (mock server)
        run: npx vitest run --reporter=verbose
        env:
          INSTANTLY_API_KEY: "mock-key-for-ci"
          INSTANTLY_USE_MOCK: "true"

      - name: Validate API client types
        run: npx tsx scripts/validate-types.ts

  integration-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"

      - run: npm ci

      - name: Integration tests (live API, read-only)
        run: npx vitest run tests/integration/ --reporter=verbose
        env:
          INSTANTLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANTLY_API_KEY }}
          INSTANTLY_BASE_URL: "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2"
```

### Step 2: API Scope Validation Script

```typescript
// scripts/validate-types.ts
// Verifies the API client types match expected Instantly v2 schema

import { InstantlyClient } from "../src/instantly/client";

async function validateApiAccess() {
  const client = new InstantlyClient();

  // Validate read-only operations work
  const campaigns = await client.getCampaigns({ limit: 1 });
  console.log("campaigns: OK");

  const accounts = await client.getAccounts({ limit: 1 });
  console.log("accounts: OK");

  console.log("All API validations passed");
}

validateApiAccess().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Validation failed:", err.message);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### Step 3: Integration Test Suite

```typescript
// tests/integration/instantly.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { InstantlyClient } from "../../src/instantly/client";

const client = new InstantlyClient();

describe("Instantly API v2 Integration", () => {
  it("should authenticate and list campaigns", async () => {
    const campaigns = await client.getCampaigns({ limit: 5 });
    expect(Array.isArray(campaigns)).toBe(true);
  });

  it("should list email accounts", async () => {
    const accounts = await client.getAccounts({ limit: 5 });
    expect(Array.isArray(accounts)).toBe(true);
  });

  it("should fetch campaign analytics", async () => {
    const campaigns = await client.getCampaigns({ limit: 1 });
    if (campaigns.length > 0) {
      const analytics = await client.getCampaignAnalytics([campaigns[0].id]);
      expect(Array.isArray(analytics)).toBe(true);
    }
  });

  it("should handle 401 on invalid key", async () => {
    const badClient = new InstantlyClient({ apiKey: "invalid-key" });
    await expect(badClient.getCampaigns({ limit: 1 })).rejects.toThrow();
  });

  it("should create and delete a lead list", async () => {
    const list = await client.request<{ id: string }>("/lead-lists", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ name: `ci-test-${Date.now()}` }),
    });
    expect(list.id).toBeDefined();

    await client.request(`/lead-lists/${list.id}`, { method: "DELETE" });
  });
});
```

### Step 4: Deployment Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Instantly Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - run: npm ci && npm run build

      - name: Deploy webhook receiver
        uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v2
        with:
          service: instantly-webhooks
          region: us-central1
          image: gcr.io/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}/instantly-webhooks
          env_vars: |
            INSTANTLY_API_KEY=${{ secrets.INSTANTLY_API_KEY }}
            INSTANTLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=${{ secrets.INSTANTLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}

      - name: Verify deployment
        run: |
          curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
            https://instantly-webhooks-abc123.run.app/health | \
            grep -q "200" && echo "Deploy OK" || exit 1
```

### Step 5: Pre-Commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .husky/pre-commit
set -euo pipefail

# Prevent committing API keys
if grep -rn "Bearer [a-zA-Z0-9_-]\{20,\}" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Possible API key found in source code"
  exit 1
fi

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run unit tests
npx vitest run --reporter=dot
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| CI fails on mock server | Mock schema doesn't match code | Update types to match v2 schema |
| Integration tests `401` | Secret not set in GitHub | Add `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` to repo secrets |
| Rate limited in CI | Too many parallel runs | Use mock server for PR checks |
| Deploy fails | Missing env vars | Check secrets are set in deployment target |
