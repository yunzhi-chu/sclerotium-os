# Instantly Hello World

## Overview

Minimal working example that lists your campaigns, checks email account health, and pulls campaign analytics — all using real Instantly API v2 endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `instantly-install-auth` setup
- At least one email account connected in Instantly
- `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` environment variable set

## Instructions

### Step 1: List Your Campaigns

```typescript
import { instantly } from "./src/instantly";

interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: number; // 0=Draft, 1=Active, 2=Paused, 3=Completed
}

const STATUS_LABELS: Record<number, string> = {
  0: "Draft", 1: "Active", 2: "Paused", 3: "Completed",
  4: "Running Subsequences", [-99]: "Suspended",
  [-1]: "Accounts Unhealthy", [-2]: "Bounce Protect",
};

async function listCampaigns() {
  const campaigns = await instantly<Campaign[]>("/campaigns?limit=10");

  console.log(`Found ${campaigns.length} campaigns:\n`);
  for (const c of campaigns) {
    console.log(`  ${c.name} [${STATUS_LABELS[c.status] ?? c.status}] — ${c.id}`);
  }
  return campaigns;
}
```

### Step 2: Check Email Account Health

```typescript
interface Account {
  email: string;
  status: number;
  warmup_status: string;
  daily_limit: number | null;
}

async function checkAccounts() {
  const accounts = await instantly<Account[]>("/accounts?limit=5");

  console.log(`\nEmail Accounts (${accounts.length}):`);
  for (const a of accounts) {
    console.log(`  ${a.email} — status: ${a.status}, warmup: ${a.warmup_status}, daily_limit: ${a.daily_limit}`);
  }

  // Test vitals for the first account
  if (accounts.length > 0) {
    const vitals = await instantly("/accounts/test/vitals", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ accounts: [accounts[0].email] }),
    });
    console.log(`\nVitals for ${accounts[0].email}:`, JSON.stringify(vitals, null, 2));
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Pull Campaign Analytics

```typescript
async function getAnalytics(campaignId: string) {
  const stats = await instantly<{
    campaign_id: string;
    total_leads: number;
    leads_contacted: number;
    emails_sent: number;
    emails_opened: number;
    emails_replied: number;
    emails_bounced: number;
  }>(`/campaigns/analytics?id=${campaignId}`);

  console.log(`\nCampaign Analytics:`);
  console.log(`  Leads: ${stats.total_leads} total, ${stats.leads_contacted} contacted`);
  console.log(`  Sent: ${stats.emails_sent}`);
  console.log(`  Opened: ${stats.emails_opened} (${((stats.emails_opened / stats.emails_sent) * 100).toFixed(1)}%)`);
  console.log(`  Replied: ${stats.emails_replied} (${((stats.emails_replied / stats.emails_sent) * 100).toFixed(1)}%)`);
  console.log(`  Bounced: ${stats.emails_bounced}`);
}
```

### Step 4: Run It All

```typescript
async function main() {
  console.log("=== Instantly API v2 Hello World ===\n");

  const campaigns = await listCampaigns();
  await checkAccounts();

  if (campaigns.length > 0) {
    await getAnalytics(campaigns[0].id);
  }

  console.log("\nDone! Your Instantly connection is working.");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Quick Test with curl

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# List campaigns
curl -s https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns?limit=3 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.[] | {name, status, id}'

# List email accounts
curl -s https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/accounts?limit=3 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.[] | {email, status}'
```

## Output

- List of campaigns with names and statuses
- Email account health overview
- Campaign analytics summary (open rate, reply rate, bounce count)
- Confirmation that Instantly API v2 is reachable

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Bad API key | Regenerate in Settings > Integrations |
| `403 Forbidden` | Missing `campaigns:read` scope | Edit API key scopes |
| Empty campaign list | No campaigns created yet | Create one in the Instantly dashboard first |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limited | Wait and retry with backoff |
