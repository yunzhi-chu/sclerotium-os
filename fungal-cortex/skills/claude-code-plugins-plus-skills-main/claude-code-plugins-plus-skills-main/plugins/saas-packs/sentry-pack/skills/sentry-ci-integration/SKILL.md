# Sentry CI Integration

## Overview

Sentry releases connect errors to the code that caused them. Automating release creation in CI/CD ensures every deploy has commit association (suspect commits), source maps for readable stack traces, and deployment tracking across environments. This skill covers `sentry-cli` commands, the official GitHub Action, build tool plugins (`@sentry/webpack-plugin`, `@sentry/vite-plugin`, `@sentry/esbuild-plugin`), and multi-platform CI configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Sentry account with a project at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` — generate at sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/ with scopes `project:releases` and `org:read`
- `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` environment variables matching your organization and project slugs
- Source maps generated during your build step (`devtool: 'source-map'` in webpack, `build.sourcemap: true` in Vite)
- Git integration installed in Sentry (sentry.io/settings/integrations/ — GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) for commit association
- `sentry-cli` available via `npm install -g @sentry/cli`, `npx @sentry/cli`, or the `getsentry/sentry-cli` Docker image

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Configure Environment Variables and Auth Token

Set up the three required environment variables in your CI platform. Every `sentry-cli` command reads these automatically.

```bash
# GitHub Actions — add as repository secrets:
#   Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_eyJ...     # Internal integration token from sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/
SENTRY_ORG=my-org                    # Organization slug (visible in sentry.io URL)
SENTRY_PROJECT=my-project            # Project slug (Settings > Projects > project name)

# Required token scopes:
#   project:releases   — create releases, upload source maps, record deploys
#   org:read           — read organization data for --auto commit association

# GitLab CI — add under Settings > CI/CD > Variables (masked + protected)
# CircleCI — add under Project Settings > Environment Variables
```

For build tool plugins (`@sentry/webpack-plugin`, `@sentry/vite-plugin`, `@sentry/esbuild-plugin`), the same three environment variables are read automatically. No additional configuration needed.

Verify your token works locally before committing CI configuration:

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_eyJ...
export SENTRY_ORG=my-org
export SENTRY_PROJECT=my-project
npx @sentry/cli info
# Should print organization name, project, and CLI version
```

### Step 2 — Create the CI Release Pipeline

The release pipeline follows five commands in sequence: create release, associate commits, upload source maps, finalize release, and record deployment.

```bash
# The five sentry-cli commands that form a complete release pipeline:
VERSION=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# 1. Create a new release (idempotent — safe to re-run)
sentry-cli releases new "$VERSION"

# 2. Associate commits for suspect commit detection (requires Git integration)
sentry-cli releases set-commits "$VERSION" --auto

# 3. Upload source maps with validation
sentry-cli releases files "$VERSION" upload-sourcemaps ./dist \
  --url-prefix '~/' \
  --validate

# 4. Mark the release as complete
sentry-cli releases finalize "$VERSION"

# 5. Record the deployment environment
sentry-cli releases deploys "$VERSION" new -e production
```

The `--validate` flag on source map upload checks that each `.map` file references a valid source file and that `sourceMappingURL` comments point to uploaded artifacts. Always use it in CI to catch mismatches early.

The `--url-prefix` must match the URL path where your JavaScript files are served. For example, if your app serves `https://example.com/assets/app.js`, use `--url-prefix '~/assets/'`. The `~/` prefix is shorthand for your domain root.

### Step 3 — Integrate Build Tool Plugins (Alternative to sentry-cli)

Build tool plugins handle source map upload during the build step itself, eliminating the need for separate `sentry-cli` commands. They automatically create releases, upload maps, and optionally delete `.map` files from the output so they are never served to clients.

**Vite** (`@sentry/vite-plugin`):

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { sentryVitePlugin } from '@sentry/vite-plugin';

export default {
  build: {
    sourcemap: true, // Required — plugin needs source maps to upload
  },
  plugins: [
    sentryVitePlugin({
      org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
      project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      release: {
        name: process.env.GITHUB_SHA || process.env.CI_COMMIT_SHA,
        setCommits: { auto: true },
        deploy: { env: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production' },
      },
      sourcemaps: {
        filesToDeleteAfterUpload: ['./dist/**/*.map'],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

**Webpack** (`@sentry/webpack-plugin`):

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const { sentryWebpackPlugin } = require('@sentry/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  devtool: 'source-map',
  plugins: [
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
      project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      release: {
        name: process.env.GITHUB_SHA || process.env.CI_COMMIT_SHA,
        setCommits: { auto: true },
        deploy: { env: 'production' },
      },
      sourcemaps: {
        assets: ['./dist/**'],
        filesToDeleteAfterUpload: ['./dist/**/*.map'],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

**esbuild** (`@sentry/esbuild-plugin`):

```javascript
// build.mjs
import { sentryEsbuildPlugin } from '@sentry/esbuild-plugin';
import esbuild from 'esbuild';

await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ['./src/index.ts'],
  bundle: true,
  sourcemap: true,
  outdir: './dist',
  plugins: [
    sentryEsbuildPlugin({
      org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
      project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      release: {
        name: process.env.GITHUB_SHA,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Install the plugin for your build tool:

```bash
# Pick one based on your build tool:
npm install --save-dev @sentry/vite-plugin
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev @sentry/esbuild-plugin
```

## Output

After completing CI integration, every deploy produces:

- A Sentry release named by commit SHA, visible at sentry.io under Releases
- Source maps uploaded and validated, enabling readable JavaScript stack traces
- Commits associated with the release, powering suspect commit detection in issue details
- A deployment record in Sentry with the target environment (production, staging, etc.)
- Source map files optionally deleted from build output when using build tool plugins

Verify the release was created:

```bash
sentry-cli releases list --org my-org --project my-project
# Shows recent releases with commit counts and deploy environments
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `error: API request failed: 401 Unauthorized` | Auth token invalid, expired, or missing | Regenerate at sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/ and update CI secret |
| `error: could not determine any commits to associate` | Git integration not installed or shallow clone | Install GitHub/GitLab integration at sentry.io/settings/integrations/ and set `fetch-depth: 0` in checkout |
| `error: could not find referenced source map` | `sourceMappingURL` comment missing from JS files | Verify `devtool: 'source-map'` (webpack) or `build.sourcemap: true` (Vite) is set |
| Source maps uploaded but stack traces still minified | `--url-prefix` does not match served URL paths | Open browser DevTools Network tab, check the URL path of your JS files, and set `--url-prefix` to match |
| `error: release already exists` | Re-running pipeline for same commit | Safe to ignore — `sentry-cli releases new` is idempotent; subsequent commands update the existing release |
| `error: org not found` | `SENTRY_ORG` does not match organization slug | Check your org slug at sentry.io/settings/ (it appears in the URL) |
| `413 Request Entity Too Large` | Source map bundle exceeds 40 MB upload limit | Split source maps per entry point or exclude vendor maps with `--ignore` flag |
| Build tool plugin silently skips upload | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` not set in CI environment | The plugins no-op when auth token is missing; ensure the secret is available to the build step |

## Examples

### Example A — GitHub Actions Full Release Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy with Sentry Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

env:
  SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}
  SENTRY_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_PROJECT }}
  SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full git history for commit association

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build with source maps
        run: npm run build

      - name: Create Sentry release and upload source maps
        run: |
          VERSION="${{ github.sha }}"
          npx @sentry/cli releases new "$VERSION"
          npx @sentry/cli releases set-commits "$VERSION" --auto
          npx @sentry/cli releases files "$VERSION" upload-sourcemaps ./dist \
            --url-prefix '~/' \
            --validate
          npx @sentry/cli releases finalize "$VERSION"
          npx @sentry/cli releases deploys "$VERSION" new -e production

      - name: Deploy application
        run: npm run deploy
```

Using the official GitHub Action as a simpler alternative:

```yaml
      - name: Create Sentry release
        uses: getsentry/action-release@v1
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}
          SENTRY_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_PROJECT }}
        with:
          environment: production
          version: ${{ github.sha }}
          sourcemaps: ./dist
          url_prefix: '~/'
          set_commits: auto
```

### Example B — Vite Plugin with GitHub Actions

When using `@sentry/vite-plugin`, the build step handles source maps automatically. No separate `sentry-cli` step needed.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy (Vite + Sentry Plugin)

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build (Vite plugin uploads source maps automatically)
        run: npm run build
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}
          SENTRY_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_PROJECT }}
          GITHUB_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Deploy application
        run: npm run deploy
```

```javascript
// vite.config.js — referenced by the workflow above
import { sentryVitePlugin } from '@sentry/vite-plugin';

export default {
  build: { sourcemap: true },
  plugins: [
    sentryVitePlugin({
      org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
      project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      release: {
        name: process.env.GITHUB_SHA,
        setCommits: { auto: true },
        deploy: { env: 'production' },
      },
      sourcemaps: {
        filesToDeleteAfterUpload: ['./dist/**/*.map'],
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Example C — GitLab CI

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy
  - sentry

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

sentry-release:
  stage: sentry
  image: getsentry/sentry-cli:latest
  variables:
    SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
    SENTRY_ORG: $SENTRY_ORG
    SENTRY_PROJECT: $SENTRY_PROJECT
  script:
    - VERSION="$CI_COMMIT_SHA"
    - sentry-cli releases new "$VERSION"
    - sentry-cli releases set-commits "$VERSION" --auto
    - sentry-cli releases files "$VERSION" upload-sourcemaps ./dist
        --url-prefix '~/'
        --validate
    - sentry-cli releases finalize "$VERSION"
    - sentry-cli releases deploys "$VERSION" new -e production
  only:
    - main
```

### Example D — CircleCI

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run:
          name: Create Sentry release
          command: |
            npm install -g @sentry/cli
            VERSION="$CIRCLE_SHA1"
            sentry-cli releases new "$VERSION"
            sentry-cli releases set-commits "$VERSION" --auto
            sentry-cli releases files "$VERSION" upload-sourcemaps ./dist \
              --url-prefix '~/' \
              --validate
            sentry-cli releases finalize "$VERSION"
            sentry-cli releases deploys "$VERSION" new -e production

workflows:
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - deploy:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main
```

### Example E — Monorepo with Multiple Sentry Projects

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml — monorepo with separate Sentry projects
jobs:
  deploy-api:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}
      SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - run: npm ci --workspace=api && npm run build --workspace=api
      - name: Sentry release for API
        run: |
          VERSION="api@${{ github.sha }}"
          npx @sentry/cli releases new "$VERSION" --project api-backend
          npx @sentry/cli releases set-commits "$VERSION" --auto
          npx @sentry/cli releases files "$VERSION" upload-sourcemaps ./api/dist \
            --project api-backend --validate
          npx @sentry/cli releases finalize "$VERSION"
          npx @sentry/cli releases deploys "$VERSION" new -e production

  deploy-web:

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - run: npm ci --workspace=web && npm run build --workspace=web
      - name: Sentry release for Web
        run: |
