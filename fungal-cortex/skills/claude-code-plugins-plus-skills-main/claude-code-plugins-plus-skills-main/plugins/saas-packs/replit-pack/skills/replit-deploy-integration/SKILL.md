# Replit Deploy Integration

## Overview

Deploy applications on Replit's hosting platform. Three deployment types: Static (free, frontend-only), Autoscale (scales to zero, pay per request), and Reserved VM (always-on, fixed cost). Includes custom domain setup, health checks, rollbacks, and deployment monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Replit Core, Pro, or Teams plan (deployment access)
- Application working in Workspace ("Run" button)
- Custom domain (optional) with DNS access

## Deployment Types

| Type | Best For | Pricing | Scale |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Static** | HTML/CSS/JS frontends | Free | CDN-backed, auto-cached |
| **Autoscale** | Variable traffic APIs | Per request | 0 to N instances |
| **Reserved VM** | Always-on services | $0.20+/day | Fixed resources |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Configure `.replit` for Deployment

```toml
# .replit — Autoscale deployment (most common)
entrypoint = "src/index.ts"
run = "npx tsx src/index.ts"

[nix]
channel = "stable-24_05"

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"

[deployment]
run = ["sh", "-c", "npx tsx src/index.ts"]
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm ci --production && npm run build"]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
```

**Reserved VM:**

```toml
[deployment]
run = ["sh", "-c", "node dist/index.js"]
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm ci && npm run build"]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
```

**Static:**

```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "static"
publicDir = "dist"
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm ci && npm run build"]
```

### Step 2: Configure Secrets for Production

```markdown
Workspace Secrets auto-sync to Deployments (2025+).

1. Click lock icon (Secrets) in sidebar
2. Add production secrets:
   - DATABASE_URL (auto-populated by Replit PostgreSQL)
   - API_KEY, JWT_SECRET, etc.
3. Verify in Deployment Settings > Environment Variables
```

### Step 3: Add Health Check Endpoint

Replit monitors your deployment via health checks. Always include one:

```typescript
// src/routes/health.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { pool } from '../services/db';

const router = Router();

router.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const checks: Record<string, any> = {
    status: 'ok',
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  };

  // Check database if configured
  if (process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
    try {
      await pool.query('SELECT 1');
      checks.database = 'connected';
    } catch {
      checks.database = 'disconnected';
      checks.status = 'degraded';
    }
  }

  // Replit-specific metadata
  checks.repl = process.env.REPL_SLUG;
  checks.region = process.env.REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT_REGION;

  const statusCode = checks.status === 'ok' ? 200 : 503;
  res.status(statusCode).json(checks);
});

export default router;
```

### Step 4: Deploy

```markdown
Via Replit UI:
1. Click "Deploy" button in the top bar
2. Select deployment type:
   - Static: for frontend-only apps
   - Autoscale: scales to zero when idle
   - Reserved VM: always-on, choose machine size
3. Configure machine size (Autoscale/VM):
   - 0.25 vCPU / 512 MB — lightweight APIs
   - 0.5 vCPU / 1 GB — standard web apps
   - 2 vCPU / 4 GB — compute-heavy apps
   - 4+ vCPU / 8-16 GB — production workloads
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Monitor build output in the deploy console
```

### Step 5: Custom Domain Setup

```markdown
1. Go to Deployment Settings > Custom Domain
2. Enter your domain: app.example.com
3. Add DNS record at your registrar:
   Type: CNAME
   Name: app
   Value: your-repl-slug.replit.app
4. Wait for SSL auto-provisioning (1-5 minutes)
5. Verify:
```

```bash
# Verify DNS
dig app.example.com CNAME

# Verify SSL
curl -I https://app.example.com

# Verify health
curl -sf https://app.example.com/health | jq .
```

For Replit-purchased domains:

- DNS managed in Replit dashboard
- MX records supported for custom email
- SSL auto-provisioned

### Step 6: Deployment Rollback

Replit supports one-click rollback to any previous successful deployment.

```markdown
1. Go to Deployment Settings > History
2. View list of past deployments with timestamps
3. Click "Rollback" on the desired version
4. Deployment reverts immediately
5. Verify health endpoint after rollback
```

### Step 7: Post-Deploy Verification

```bash
set -euo pipefail
DEPLOY_URL="https://your-app.replit.app"

echo "=== Deployment Verification ==="

# Health check
echo -n "Health: "
curl -sf "$DEPLOY_URL/health" | jq -r '.status'

# Response time
echo -n "Response time: "
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}s\n" "$DEPLOY_URL/"

# SSL certificate
echo -n "SSL: "
curl -sI "$DEPLOY_URL" | grep -i "strict-transport" && echo "OK" || echo "Missing HSTS"

# Autoscale cold start test
echo "Cold start test: wait 10 min, then curl again"
```

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Deploy fails at build | Dependency error | Test `npm ci && npm run build` locally first |
| 503 after deploy | App crashes on start | Check deployment logs, verify secrets |
| Port mismatch | Not using PORT env | `app.listen(process.env.PORT \|\| 3000)` |
| Cold start slow (>10s) | Heavy imports on startup | Lazy-load non-critical modules |
| Custom domain 404 | DNS not propagated | Wait, or verify CNAME record |
| SSL not provisioning | Wrong DNS record | Must be CNAME to `.replit.app` |
