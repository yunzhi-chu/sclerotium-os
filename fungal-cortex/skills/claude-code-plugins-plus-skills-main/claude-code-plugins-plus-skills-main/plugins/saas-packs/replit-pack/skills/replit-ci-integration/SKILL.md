# Replit CI Integration

## Overview

Set up CI/CD for Replit apps: GitHub repo connected to Replit, automated testing via GitHub Actions, deploy-on-push, and post-deploy health verification. Replit supports direct GitHub import and auto-sync.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Replit App connected to GitHub (Settings > Git > Connect)
- GitHub Secrets configured for deploy verification

## Instructions

### Step 1: Connect Replit to GitHub

```markdown
1. In your Repl, click "Git" in the sidebar
2. Click "Connect to GitHub"
3. Authorize Replit GitHub App
4. Select your repository
5. Changes pushed to GitHub auto-sync to Replit

Alternative: Import from GitHub
1. Create new Repl > "Import from GitHub"
2. Paste repo URL
3. Replit clones and configures automatically
```

### Step 2: GitHub Actions — Test on PR

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test -- --coverage
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run build
```

### Step 3: Deploy Verification After Push

Replit auto-deploys when you push to the connected branch. Verify the deployment is healthy:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-verify.yml
name: Verify Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Wait for Replit to pick up the push and deploy
    steps:
      - name: Wait for deployment
        run: sleep 60

      - name: Health check
        run: |
          DEPLOY_URL="${{ secrets.REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL }}"
          STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$DEPLOY_URL/health")
          if [ "$STATUS" != "200" ]; then
            echo "Health check failed: HTTP $STATUS"
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Deployment healthy"

      - name: Response time check
        run: |
          DEPLOY_URL="${{ secrets.REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL }}"
          TIME=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" "$DEPLOY_URL/health")
          echo "Response time: ${TIME}s"
          # Alert if response > 5 seconds (cold start)
          if (( $(echo "$TIME > 5" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "WARNING: Slow response (possible cold start)"
          fi
```

### Step 4: Store Deployment Secrets

```bash
# Set GitHub secrets for deploy verification
gh secret set REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL --body "https://your-app.replit.app"

# Optional: Replit API token for advanced deployments
gh secret set REPLIT_TOKEN --body "your-replit-api-token"
```

### Step 5: Branch Protection

```yaml
# Require tests to pass before merge
# In GitHub: Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules

# Required status checks:
required_status_checks:
  - "test"

# Recommended settings:
# - Require pull request reviews before merging
# - Require status checks to pass before merging
# - Require branches to be up to date before merging
```

### Step 6: GitHub Actions — Deploy from GitHub Repo

For repos not directly connected to Replit, deploy via GitHub Import:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-replit.yml
name: Deploy to Replit

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run tests first
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm test
          npm run build

      - name: Trigger Replit deployment
        run: |
          # Replit auto-deploys from connected GitHub repos
          # For manual trigger, use Replit API:
          curl -X POST \
            "https://replit.com/api/v1/repls/${{ secrets.REPL_ID }}/deploy" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.REPLIT_TOKEN }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"

      - name: Verify deployment
        run: |
          sleep 90  # Wait for build + deploy
          curl -sf "${{ secrets.REPLIT_DEPLOY_URL }}/health"
```

### Step 7: Python CI Variant

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-python.yml
name: Test Python

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
          cache: 'pip'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: python -m pytest tests/ -v
      - run: python -m flake8 .
```

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| GitHub sync not working | App not connected | Reconnect in Replit Git settings |
| Deploy verification timeout | Slow Autoscale cold start | Increase sleep, or use Reserved VM |
| Tests pass but deploy fails | Build step missing | Add `build` to `.replit` deployment section |
| Secret not found in Actions | Not set in GitHub | `gh secret set` with correct name |
