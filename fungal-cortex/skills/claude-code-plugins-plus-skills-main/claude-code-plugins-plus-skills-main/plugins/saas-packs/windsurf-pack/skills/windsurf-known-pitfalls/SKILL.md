# Windsurf Known Pitfalls

## Overview

Real gotchas when using Windsurf IDE. Cascade, Supercomplete, workspace indexing, and the rules system each have behaviors that catch developers off guard. Learn from these before they catch you.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf installed and configured
- Understanding of Cascade vs Supercomplete
- Awareness of workspace indexing behavior

## Instructions

### Pitfall 1: Using Cascade for Simple Tasks

**The mistake:** Opening Cascade (Cmd+L) to complete a single line of code.

```
BAD: Opening Cascade to write "add a console.log"
→ Cascade spins up full agent context, reads multiple files = slow and expensive

GOOD: Use Supercomplete (Tab) for inline completions
→ Instant, free, no credits consumed

RULE OF THUMB:
- Single line / simple completion → Tab (Supercomplete)
- Inline edit of selection → Cmd+I (Command)
- Multi-file task / complex reasoning → Cmd+L (Cascade)
```

### Pitfall 2: Opening Monorepo Root in Windsurf

**The mistake:** Opening a 100K+ file monorepo as a single workspace.

```
BAD:  windsurf ~/company-monorepo/
→ Cascade indexes everything, slow context, vague suggestions

GOOD: windsurf ~/company-monorepo/services/payments/
→ Focused context, fast indexing, precise suggestions

WHY: Cascade's context window is limited. More files = more noise.
A focused workspace with 5K files gives better suggestions than
a bloated workspace with 100K files.
```

### Pitfall 3: Vague Cascade Prompts

**The mistake:** Giving Cascade broad, unscoped instructions.

```
BAD: "Refactor the codebase to use TypeScript"
→ Cascade may try to convert EVERY file at once, breaking everything

BAD: "Add validation to the API"
→ Which API? Which endpoints? What validation rules?

GOOD: "Convert src/utils/api.js to TypeScript. Add proper types for
all function parameters and return values. Don't change other files."

GOOD: "In src/routes/users.ts, add zod validation for the POST /users
endpoint. Validate email format, name length (2-50 chars), and role
must be 'admin' or 'user'. Return 400 with field-level errors."
```

### Pitfall 4: Accepting Changes Without Review

**The mistake:** Accepting all Cascade changes without reading the diffs.

```
BAD: Cascade modifies 12 files → "Accept All" → broken tests
→ Cascade may have changed shared utilities, removed error handling,
  or introduced dependencies on APIs that don't exist

GOOD:
1. Read Cascade's explanation of what it changed
2. Review each file diff in the Cascade output
3. Check for: removed error handling, new imports, changed signatures
4. Run tests BEFORE committing
5. Use revert button if any file looks wrong
```

### Pitfall 5: Not Checkpointing Before Cascade

**The mistake:** Running Cascade on a dirty working tree without a Git checkpoint.

```
BAD: Uncomitted changes + Cascade edits = impossible to separate
→ Can't tell what was your work vs what Cascade changed
→ Can't revert Cascade changes without losing your work

GOOD: git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint: before cascade"
→ Clean separation between your work and Cascade's
→ Easy revert: git checkout -- .
```

### Pitfall 6: Conflicting AI Extensions

**The mistake:** Running GitHub Copilot alongside Windsurf.

```
KNOWN CONFLICTS:
- GitHub Copilot — conflicts with Supercomplete
  Symptoms: duplicate suggestions, wrong completions, slow editor

- TabNine — conflicts with Supercomplete
  Symptoms: competing inline suggestions

- Cody (Sourcegraph) — conflicts with Cascade
  Symptoms: multiple AI panels, context confusion

FIX: Disable competing extensions
Settings > Extensions > search "copilot" > Disable
```

### Pitfall 7: Ignoring .windsurfrules Character Limits

**The mistake:** Writing a 20,000 character .windsurfrules file.

```
LIMITS:
- .windsurfrules: 6,000 characters max
- Global rules (global_rules.md): 6,000 characters max
- Combined total: 12,000 characters max
- Individual workspace rules (.windsurf/rules/*.md): 12,000 chars each

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EXCEEDED:
- Content is SILENTLY TRUNCATED
- Global rules take priority over workspace rules
- You won't get an error — just missing context

FIX: Keep .windsurfrules concise (stack, patterns, don'ts)
Move detailed rules to .windsurf/rules/ with trigger modes
```

### Pitfall 8: Long Cascade Conversations

**The mistake:** Using a single Cascade conversation for hours of work.

```
BAD: 50-message Cascade conversation spanning multiple topics
→ Context window fills up, Cascade "forgets" early context
→ Suggestions become inconsistent or contradictory

GOOD: One task per Cascade session
→ Click + icon to start new conversation for each new task
→ Clean context = better suggestions
→ Use Memories for facts that should persist across sessions
```

### Pitfall 9: Pasting Secrets into Cascade

**The mistake:** Sharing API keys or credentials in Cascade chat.

```
BAD: "My API key is sk-abc123def456, why isn't auth working?"
→ Secret is now in Cascade's context, may appear in suggestions later

GOOD: "I'm getting auth errors with the API key from .env. The error
message is 'Invalid API key'. What should I check?"
→ Cascade can help without seeing the actual secret
```

### Pitfall 10: Not Using Turbo Mode Safely

**The mistake:** Enabling Turbo mode without configuring deny lists.

```
BAD: Turbo mode ON + no deny list
→ Cascade auto-runs `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, etc.

GOOD: Turbo mode ON + configured deny list
→ Fast auto-execution for safe commands (npm test, git status)
→ Manual approval for dangerous commands (rm, sudo, push --force)

CONFIGURE:
Settings > cascadeCommandsDenyList > add destructive commands
```

## Error Handling

| Pitfall | Symptom | Prevention |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Wrong tool for task | Slow response for simple task | Tab for completions, Cmd+L for complex |
| Giant workspace | Slow indexing, vague AI | Open service directory, not root |
| Vague prompts | Wrong files modified | Specify paths, constraints, expected output |
| No review | Broken build after Cascade | Always review diffs, run tests |
| No checkpoint | Can't undo Cascade work | Always commit before Cascade |
| AI conflicts | Duplicate/wrong suggestions | Disable competing extensions |
| Over-limit rules | Silently truncated | Check char counts, use workspace rules |
| Long conversations | Context degradation | New session per task |
| Secrets in chat | Potential data exposure | Never paste actual credentials |
| Unsafe Turbo | Destructive commands auto-run | Configure deny list |

## Examples

### Pre-Cascade Checklist

```bash
set -euo pipefail
echo "=== Pre-Cascade Checklist ==="
echo "Git clean: $(git status --porcelain | wc -l | xargs) uncommitted files"
echo "On branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "Rules: $(wc -c < .windsurfrules 2>/dev/null || echo 0) chars (max 6000)"
echo "Conflicting exts: $(windsurf --list-extensions 2>/dev/null | grep -ci 'copilot\|tabnine\|cody' || echo 0)"
```

### Common Prompt Templates

```
Feature: "In [file], add [feature] that [behavior]. Follow the pattern
in @[reference-file]. Include error handling for [edge cases]. Don't
modify [protected files]."

Bug fix: "@[file] The function [name] fails when [condition]. The error
is [error message]. Fix it and add a test for this edge case."

Refactor: "Extract [logic] from [file] into a new [file]. Update all
imports. Run tests after. Don't change public API signatures."
```
