# Windsurf Observability

## Overview

Monitor Windsurf AI IDE adoption, feature usage, and productivity impact across your team. Covers Admin Dashboard analytics, custom tracking via extensions, and ROI measurement.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf Teams or Enterprise plan
- Admin dashboard access at windsurf.com/dashboard
- Team members actively using Windsurf

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access Admin Dashboard Analytics

Navigate to Admin Dashboard > Analytics for team-wide metrics:

```yaml
# Key metrics available in Windsurf Admin Dashboard
core_metrics:
  adoption:
    active_users_daily: "Unique developers using Windsurf per day"
    seat_utilization: "Active users / total seats (target: >80%)"
    feature_adoption: "Which AI features each user uses"

  quality:
    completion_acceptance_rate: "Supercomplete suggestions accepted vs shown"
    cascade_flow_success_rate: "Cascade tasks completed vs failed"

  consumption:
    credits_consumed_per_user: "Monthly credit usage per team member"
    credits_by_model: "Which AI models consume the most credits"

  efficiency:
    tasks_per_session: "Average Cascade interactions per session"
    time_saved_estimate: "Based on task complexity and completion speed"
```

### Step 2: Set Up Usage Alerts

Monitor for underutilization and overuse:

```yaml
# Alert thresholds for team management
alerts:
  low_adoption:
    condition: "seat_utilization < 50% for 7 days"
    action: "Schedule team training session"

  low_acceptance_rate:
    condition: "completion_acceptance_rate < 20% for 7 days"
    action: "Review .windsurfrules — AI suggestions not matching project patterns"

  high_cascade_failures:
    condition: "cascade_success_rate < 50% for 3 days"
    action: "Check workspace config — .codeiumignore may be too aggressive"

  credit_overspend:
    condition: "team_credits > 80% consumed before month half"
    action: "Review per-user usage, coach on credit conservation"

  inactive_seats:
    condition: "user has <10 interactions in 30 days"
    action: "Offer training or downgrade to Free tier"
```

### Step 3: Build Custom Extension for Detailed Tracking

```typescript
// windsurf-analytics-extension/src/extension.ts
import * as vscode from "vscode";

interface UsageEvent {
  event: string;
  timestamp: string;
  userId: string;
  file?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

const events: UsageEvent[] = [];

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // Track Cascade usage patterns
  const cascadeListener = vscode.workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument((doc) => {
    events.push({
      event: "file_save_after_cascade",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      userId: vscode.env.machineId,
      file: doc.fileName,
      metadata: { languageId: doc.languageId, lineCount: doc.lineCount },
    });
  });

  // Flush events periodically
  setInterval(() => {
    if (events.length > 0) {
      const batch = events.splice(0);
      sendToAnalytics(batch);
    }
  }, 60000); // Flush every minute

  context.subscriptions.push(cascadeListener);
}

async function sendToAnalytics(batch: UsageEvent[]) {
  const endpoint = vscode.workspace
    .getConfiguration("windsurf-analytics")
    .get<string>("endpoint");
  if (!endpoint) return;

  await fetch(endpoint, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ events: batch }),
  }).catch(() => {}); // Silently fail — analytics should never block work
}
```

### Step 4: Measure Productivity Impact

```yaml
# Weekly team productivity report template
productivity_report:
  period: "Week of YYYY-MM-DD"
  team_size: 10
  active_windsurf_users: 8

  ai_metrics:
    total_cascade_tasks: 150
    cascade_success_rate: "78%"
    completion_acceptance_rate: "32%"
    credits_consumed: 1200

  productivity_proxies:
    commits_per_developer: 12       # vs baseline 8 pre-Windsurf
    pr_turnaround_hours: 6          # vs baseline 12 pre-Windsurf
    code_review_comments: 45        # quality indicator

  estimated_time_saved:
    per_developer_per_week: "3 hours"
    total_team_per_week: "24 hours"
    monthly_value: "$7,200"         # 24hrs * 4wks * $75/hr

  roi_calculation:
    monthly_windsurf_cost: "$300"   # 10 seats * $30
    monthly_value_generated: "$7,200"
    roi: "2,300%"
```

### Step 5: Dashboard Visualization

Track these metrics over time in your preferred dashboard tool:

```markdown
## Recommended Dashboard Panels

1. Daily Active Users vs Total Seats (line chart)
   - Shows adoption trend
   - Alert when utilization drops below 70%

2. Completion Acceptance Rate (line chart, 7-day rolling avg)
   - Higher = better .windsurfrules quality
   - Drop = rules need updating or team needs training

3. Cascade Success Rate (bar chart, weekly)
   - Tracks agentic task effectiveness
   - Low rate = prompts too vague or workspace too large

4. Credits per Developer (bar chart, monthly)
   - Identifies power users vs underutilizers
   - Guides seat tier decisions

5. Top Workflows Used (table)
   - Shows which automated workflows team uses most
   - Identifies candidates for new workflows
```

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Low acceptance rate | AI suggestions don't match project style | Update .windsurfrules with project conventions |
| Cascade flow failures | Insufficient tool permissions or context | Check workspace config, .codeiumignore |
| Seat utilization low | Team not adopted | Training session, share productivity data |
| Analytics data missing | Not on Teams/Enterprise plan | Upgrade for admin analytics |
| Custom extension conflicts | Extension interferes with Cascade | Ensure extension doesn't register completions |

## Examples

### Quick Adoption Check

```
Admin Dashboard > Analytics > Overview
Look for: active users, acceptance rate, credit usage
```

### Monthly Seat Optimization

```yaml
steps:
  1. Export member usage from Admin Dashboard
  2. Sort by credits consumed (ascending)
  3. Bottom 20%: offer training or downgrade to Free
  4. Top 10%: interview for best practices to share
  5. Reallocate freed seats to new team members
```
