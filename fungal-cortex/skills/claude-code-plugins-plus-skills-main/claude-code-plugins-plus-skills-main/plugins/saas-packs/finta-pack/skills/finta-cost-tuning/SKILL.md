# Finta Cost Tuning

## Overview

Finta pricing is per-seat with tiered feature access, and the primary cost driver is investor pipeline sync volume. Each fundraising round generates hundreds of investor interactions — updates, document shares, and payment collections — that all flow through Finta's API. Over-syncing investor data, maintaining unused deal rooms, and keeping inactive seats during non-fundraising periods waste budget. Strategic plan selection and sync optimization ensure you only pay for what active fundraising demands.

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Cost Driver | Optimization |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Seat licenses | Per-user/month pricing | Remove seats between fundraising rounds |
| Deal rooms | Each active deal room consumes quota | Archive completed deal rooms promptly |
| Investor pipeline syncs | API calls per investor update | Batch investor updates; sync only changed records |
| Payment processing | Stripe/ACH transaction fees | Consolidate payment rounds to minimize transactions |
| Document sharing | Storage and delivery per shared document | Deduplicate documents; use shared links over copies |

## API Call Reduction

```typescript
class FintaPipelineSync {
  private lastSyncTimestamp = 0;
  private investorCache = new Map<string, { data: any; hash: string }>();

  async incrementalSync(investors: any[]): Promise<any[]> {
    const changed = investors.filter(inv => {
      const cached = this.investorCache.get(inv.id);
      const currentHash = this.hashInvestor(inv);
      if (cached && cached.hash === currentHash) return false;
      this.investorCache.set(inv.id, { data: inv, hash: currentHash });
      return true;
    });
    // Only sync investors with actual changes — typically reduces calls by 60-80%
    return this.batchUpdate(changed);
  }

  private hashInvestor(inv: any): string {
    return JSON.stringify({ status: inv.status, amount: inv.amount, stage: inv.stage });
  }

  private async batchUpdate(investors: any[]): Promise<any[]> {
    // Chunk into batches of 25 to stay within rate limits
    const size = 25;
    const batches = Array.from({ length: Math.ceil(investors.length / size) },
      (_, i) => investors.slice(i * size, i * size + size));
    return Promise.all(batches.map(batch => fetch('/api/investors/bulk', {
      method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(batch)
    })));
  }
}
```

## Usage Monitoring

```typescript
class FintaCostTracker {
  private syncsToday = 0;
  private dailyBudget = 500;

  recordSync(investorCount: number): void {
    this.syncsToday += investorCount;
    const utilization = (this.syncsToday / this.dailyBudget) * 100;
    if (utilization > 80) {
      console.warn(`Finta sync budget ${utilization.toFixed(0)}% used: ${this.syncsToday}/${this.dailyBudget}`);
    }
  }

  shouldSync(): boolean {
    return this.syncsToday < this.dailyBudget;
  }

  resetDaily(): void { this.syncsToday = 0; }
}
```

## Cost Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Remove unused seats during non-fundraising periods
- [ ] Archive completed deal rooms within 7 days of round close
- [ ] Use incremental sync — only push changed investor records
- [ ] Batch investor updates in groups of 25
- [ ] Consolidate payment collections to reduce per-transaction fees
- [ ] Deduplicate shared documents using shared links
- [ ] Set daily sync budget alerts at 80% threshold
- [ ] Review plan tier quarterly — downgrade during dormant periods

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Sync budget exceeded | Polling all investors on short interval | Switch to change-detection with hash comparison |
| Stale investor data | Cache TTL too long during active round | Reduce TTL to 5 min during active fundraising |
| Payment processing fees spike | Many small transactions | Batch payment collections into weekly rounds |
| Deal room quota exhausted | Old rooms not archived | Auto-archive rooms 7 days after round close |
| Duplicate document uploads | Same doc shared to multiple rooms | Use shared link references instead of copies |
