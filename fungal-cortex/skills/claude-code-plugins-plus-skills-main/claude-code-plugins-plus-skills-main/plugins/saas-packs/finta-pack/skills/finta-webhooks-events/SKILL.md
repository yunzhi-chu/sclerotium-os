# Finta Webhooks & Events

## Overview

Finta supports event automation through its built-in automation rules and Zapier integration. Pipeline stage changes, investor replies, and deal room views can trigger external actions.

## Built-in Automation Rules

Configure in Settings > Automation:

- **Email reply detected** -> Move to next stage
- **Calendar meeting scheduled** -> Log and notify team
- **Deal room viewed** -> Send Slack notification
- **No response in X days** -> Create follow-up reminder

## Zapier Integration

Available triggers:

1. Pipeline stage changed
2. New investor added
3. Deal room accessed
4. Investor update sent

Example Zap: Finta stage change -> Slack message + Google Sheets row

## Custom Reminder System

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def get_followup_reminders(export_path: str, days: int = 5) -> list:
    df = pd.read_csv(export_path)
    df["Last Contact"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Last Contact"])
    cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days)
    overdue = df[
        (df["Stage"].isin(["Reaching Out", "Follow-up"]))
        & (df["Last Contact"] < cutoff)
    ]
    return overdue[["Name", "Firm", "Email", "Last Contact", "Stage"]].to_dict("records")
```
