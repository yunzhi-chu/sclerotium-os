# Shopify B2B & Wholesale

## Overview

Shopify Plus B2B features let you create separate wholesale experiences with company accounts, custom catalogs, and tiered pricing. This skill covers the full B2B setup: companies, catalogs, price lists, and checkout configuration using the GraphQL Admin API. Requires a Shopify Plus plan.

## Prerequisites

- Shopify Plus plan (B2B features are Plus-only)
- Access scopes: `read_customers`, `write_customers`, `read_products`, `write_products`, `read_orders`
- B2B enabled in Shopify admin (Settings > B2B)
- API version 2023-10 or later (B2B mutations stabilized)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create a B2B Company

Use `companyCreate` with `CompanyCreateInput` — requires `company` (name, note), `companyContact` (email, firstName, lastName), and `companyLocation` (name, billingAddress, shippingAddress):

```typescript
await client.request(COMPANY_CREATE, {
  variables: {
    input: {
      company: { name: "Acme Wholesale Inc", note: "Tier 1 partner" },
      companyContact: { email: "buyer@acme.com", firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" },
      companyLocation: {
        name: "Headquarters",
        billingAddress: { address1: "123 Commerce St", city: "Austin", provinceCode: "TX", countryCode: "US", zip: "78701" },
        shippingAddress: { address1: "123 Commerce St", city: "Austin", provinceCode: "TX", countryCode: "US", zip: "78701" },
      },
    },
  },
});
// Always check userErrors in response — returns code like COMPANY_NOT_FOUND, INVALID
```

See [references/company-management.md](references/company-management.md) for the full mutation, additional contacts, locations, and roles.

### Step 2: Create a Catalog

Catalogs link products to specific companies. Use `catalogCreate` with a title, status, and `context.companyLocationIds`:

```typescript
await client.request(CATALOG_CREATE, {
  variables: {
    input: {
      title: "Wholesale Tier 1",
      status: "ACTIVE",
      context: { companyLocationIds: ["gid://shopify/CompanyLocation/123456"] },
    },
  },
});
```

### Step 3: Set Wholesale Pricing

Create a price list with `priceListCreate`. Use `PERCENTAGE_DECREASE` for blanket discounts or `priceListFixedPricesAdd` for per-variant overrides:

```typescript
// 30% off all products in this catalog
await client.request(PRICE_LIST_CREATE, {
  variables: {
    input: {
      name: "Wholesale 30% Off",
      currency: "USD",
      parent: { adjustment: { type: "PERCENTAGE_DECREASE", value: 30 } },
      catalogId: "gid://shopify/Catalog/789",
    },
  },
});
```

For fixed price overrides, volume pricing, and multi-currency, see [references/catalog-pricing.md](references/catalog-pricing.md).

### Step 4: B2B Checkout Configuration

B2B orders use `draftOrderCreate` with `purchaseOrder` number and `purchasingEntity` linking to the company. Key fields:

```typescript
await client.request(DRAFT_ORDER_CREATE, {
  variables: {
    input: {
      purchaseOrder: "PO-2026-0042",
      lineItems: [{ variantId: "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/123", quantity: 100 }],
      purchasingEntity: {
        purchasingCompany: {
          companyId: "gid://shopify/Company/456",
          companyContactId: "gid://shopify/CompanyContact/789",
          companyLocationId: "gid://shopify/CompanyLocation/012",
        },
      },
      paymentTerms: { paymentTermsTemplateId: "gid://shopify/PaymentTermsTemplate/1" },
    },
  },
});
```

Payment terms templates: Due on receipt, Net 15, Net 30, Net 45, Net 60, Net 90. Query available templates with `paymentTermsTemplates`.

See [references/b2b-checkout.md](references/b2b-checkout.md) for the full draft order flow, invoice sending, and vaulted payments.

## Output

- B2B company created with contact and billing/shipping addresses
- Catalog linked to specific company locations
- Wholesale price list with percentage or fixed pricing
- Draft orders with purchase order numbers and payment terms

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `COMPANY_NOT_FOUND` | Invalid company GID | Verify the company ID exists via `companyQuery` |
| `CATALOG_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Max catalogs per context reached | Remove unused catalogs or upgrade plan |
| `PRICE_LIST_NOT_FOUND` | Price list not linked to catalog | Ensure `catalogId` is set on price list |
| `B2B_NOT_ENABLED` | B2B feature not activated | Enable B2B in Shopify admin Settings > B2B (requires Plus) |
| `COMPANY_CONTACT_NOT_FOUND` | Contact not associated with company | Create contact via `companyContactCreate` first |
| `INVALID_PURCHASING_ENTITY` | Missing company/contact/location in draft order | All three IDs required in `purchasingCompany` |

## Examples

### Onboarding a New Wholesale Partner

Create a B2B company with multiple contacts, locations, and roles for a new wholesale account joining your program.

See [Company Management](references/company-management.md) for the full mutation and multi-contact setup.

### Setting Up Tiered Wholesale Pricing

Configure percentage-based discounts for standard wholesalers and fixed per-variant overrides for VIP partners using price lists.

See [Catalog Pricing](references/catalog-pricing.md) for percentage, fixed price, and volume pricing strategies.

### Processing a B2B Purchase Order

Create a draft order with a PO number, Net 30 payment terms, and company association for a wholesale buyer.

See [B2B Checkout](references/b2b-checkout.md) for the full draft order flow, invoice sending, and vaulted payments.
