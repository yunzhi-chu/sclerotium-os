# Shopify Migration Deep Dive

## Overview

Migrate product catalogs, customers, and orders to Shopify using the GraphQL Admin API bulk mutations, CSV imports, and incremental migration patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Source platform data exported (CSV, JSON, or API access)
- Shopify store with appropriate access scopes
- Scopes needed: `write_products`, `write_customers`, `write_orders`, `write_inventory`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Assess Migration Scope

| Data Type | Shopify Import Method | Complexity |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Products + variants | `productSet` mutation (upsert) | Low |
| Product images | `productCreateMedia` mutation | Low |
| Customers | Customer CSV import or `customerCreate` | Medium |
| Historical orders | `draftOrderCreate` + `draftOrderComplete` | High |
| Inventory levels | `inventorySetQuantities` mutation | Medium |
| Collections | `collectionCreate` mutation | Low |
| Redirects (URLs) | `urlRedirectCreate` mutation | Low |
| Metafields | Included in product/customer mutations | Medium |

### Step 2: Bulk Product Import with productSet

`productSet` is idempotent — it creates or updates based on `handle`, making it perfect for migrations. Handles variants, metafields, and all product attributes in a single mutation.

See [Product Set Migration](references/product-set-migration.md) for the complete migration function.

### Step 3: Bulk Operations for Large Imports

For importing thousands of products, use Shopify's staged uploads combined with bulk mutation to avoid rate limit issues.

See [Bulk Operations Import](references/bulk-operations-import.md) for the staged upload and bulk mutation workflow.

### Step 4: Set Inventory Levels & URL Redirects

After products are created, set inventory quantities at each location and create URL redirects to preserve SEO from the old platform.

See [Inventory and Redirects](references/inventory-and-redirects.md) for both mutation implementations.

### Step 5: Post-Migration Validation

Automated validation that compares expected source counts against actual Shopify counts for products, customers, and other data types.

See [Post-Migration Validation](references/post-migration-validation.md) for the validation script.

## Output

- Products migrated with variants, images, and metafields
- Inventory levels set at correct locations
- URL redirects preserving SEO
- Migration validated against source counts

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `TAKEN` on product handle | Duplicate handle | Append suffix or use `productSet` for upsert |
| Rate limited during import | Too many sequential calls | Use bulk operations or add delays |
| Image upload fails | URL not publicly accessible | Use staged uploads for private images |
| Inventory not updating | Wrong `inventoryItemId` | Query variant's `inventoryItem.id` first |

## Examples

### Quick Migration Status

```bash
# Count products in source vs Shopify
echo "Shopify product count:"
curl -sf -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ productsCount { count } }"}' \
  "https://$STORE/admin/api/${SHOPIFY_API_VERSION:-2025-04}/graphql.json" \
  | jq '.data.productsCount.count'
```
