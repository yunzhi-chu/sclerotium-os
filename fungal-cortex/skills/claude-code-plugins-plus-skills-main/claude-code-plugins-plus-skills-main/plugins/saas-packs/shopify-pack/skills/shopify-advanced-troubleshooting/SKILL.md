# Shopify Advanced Troubleshooting

## Overview

Deep debugging for complex Shopify API issues: cost analysis with debug headers, webhook delivery inspection, GraphQL query introspection, and systematic isolation of intermittent failures.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Shopify admin and Partner Dashboard
- Familiarity with GraphQL and HTTP debugging
- `curl` and `jq` available

## Instructions

### Step 1: GraphQL Cost Analysis

When queries THROTTLE unexpectedly, use the cost debug header by adding `Shopify-GraphQL-Cost-Debug: 1` to your request. The response `extensions.cost` reveals why a query is expensive.

**Key:** `requestedQueryCost` is `first` multiplied through nested connections. `50 products * 20 variants * (1 + 5 metafields)` = high cost even if actual data is small.

### Step 2: Trace a Specific Request

Every Shopify response includes `X-Request-Id`. Capture it for support escalation:

```bash
curl -v -X POST "https://$STORE/admin/api/2025-04/graphql.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ shop { name } }"}' 2>&1 | tee /tmp/shopify-debug.txt

grep -i "x-request-id" /tmp/shopify-debug.txt
```

### Step 3: Webhook Delivery Inspection

Inspect webhook delivery status in the Partner Dashboard, or query subscription health via API.

See [Webhook Status Query](references/webhook-status-query.md) for the complete query and common delivery failure patterns.

### Step 4: GraphQL Introspection for API Version Differences

Use introspection queries to check if specific fields or mutations exist in your API version. Query `__type` for field lists or `__schema` for available mutations filtered by prefix.

### Step 5: Systematic Isolation

Run a layer-by-layer diagnostic that tests DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTP, GraphQL, and rate limit state independently.

See [Layer-by-Layer Diagnostic](references/layer-by-layer-diagnostic.md) for the complete shell script.

### Step 6: Debug Intermittent Failures

Wrap Shopify calls in a debug logger that captures timing, cost, and error data for pattern analysis.

See [Debug Intermittent Failures](references/debug-intermittent-failures.md) for the complete TypeScript implementation.

## Output

- Query cost breakdown identifying expensive fields
- Request IDs captured for Shopify support
- Webhook delivery health verified
- Layer-by-layer isolation identifying failure point
- Debug log with timing patterns for intermittent issues

## Error Handling

| Issue | Root Cause Pattern | Solution |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Random THROTTLED errors | `requestedQueryCost` spikes on specific queries | Reduce `first:` and nested depth |
| Webhooks stop arriving | SSL certificate expired | Renew cert, check webhook subscriptions |
| 502 errors on GraphQL | Shopify infrastructure blip | Retry with backoff, capture X-Request-Id |
| Slow responses (> 5s) | Complex query with metafields | Remove `metafields` or reduce page size |
| Data inconsistency | Race condition between webhook and query | Use `updatedAt` filter, add idempotency |

## Examples

### Diagnosing Intermittent 502 Errors

A store experiences random 502 errors on product sync queries. Use the debug wrapper to capture timing and cost data across 100 requests, then analyze the pattern.

See [Debug Intermittent Failures](references/debug-intermittent-failures.md) for the complete TypeScript implementation.

### Isolating a Webhook Delivery Gap

Orders are created but the fulfillment webhook never fires. Run the webhook status query to check subscription health and delivery success rates.

See [Webhook Status Query](references/webhook-status-query.md) for the complete query and common delivery failure patterns.

### Pinpointing a Network Layer Failure

API calls fail sporadically from a specific server. Run the layer-by-layer diagnostic to test DNS, TCP, TLS, HTTP, and GraphQL independently.

See [Layer-by-Layer Diagnostic](references/layer-by-layer-diagnostic.md) for the complete shell script.
