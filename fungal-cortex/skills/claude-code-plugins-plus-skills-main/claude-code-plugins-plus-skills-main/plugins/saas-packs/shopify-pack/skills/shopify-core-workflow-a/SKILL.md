# Shopify Products & Catalog Management

## Overview

Primary workflow for Shopify: manage products, variants, collections, and inventory using the GraphQL Admin API. Covers CRUD operations with real API mutations and response shapes.

## Prerequisites

- Completed `shopify-install-auth` setup
- Access scopes: `read_products`, `write_products`, `read_inventory`, `write_inventory`
- API version 2024-10 or later (ProductInput was split in this version)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Product

Use `productCreate` with `ProductCreateInput` (as of 2024-10, this replaced the old unified `ProductInput`). Always check `userErrors` -- Shopify returns 200 even on validation failures.

See [Product Create Mutation](references/product-create-mutation.md) for the complete mutation, variables, and error handling.

### Step 2: Update a Product

Use `productUpdate` with `ProductUpdateInput` (separate from create as of 2024-10). Supports metafield updates inline.

See [Product Update Mutation](references/product-update-mutation.md) for the complete mutation and variables.

### Step 3: Query Products with Filtering

Search products using Shopify's query syntax (`status:active`, `product_type:Apparel AND vendor:'My Brand'`, `tag:sale`, etc.) with cursor-based pagination.

See [Search Products Query](references/search-products-query.md) for the complete query with pagination and query syntax examples.

### Step 4: Manage Variants and Pricing

Create variants in bulk with `productVariantsBulkCreate`, including pricing, SKU, barcode, option values, and inventory quantities per location.

See [Bulk Create Variants](references/bulk-create-variants.md) for the complete mutation and variables.

### Step 5: Manage Collections

Create smart (automated) collections with rule-based product matching using tag, product type, and other column filters.

See [Smart Collection Create](references/smart-collection-create.md) for the complete mutation and variables.

## Output

- Product created with variants and options
- Products queryable with search filters
- Variant pricing and inventory configured
- Smart collections auto-organizing products

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `userErrors: [{code: "TAKEN", field: ["handle"]}]` | Duplicate product handle | Use a unique handle or let Shopify auto-generate |
| `userErrors: [{code: "BLANK", field: ["title"]}]` | Empty required field | Provide non-empty title |
| `userErrors: [{code: "INVALID"}]` | Invalid metafield type | Check `type` matches Shopify's metafield types |
| `Access denied` on `productCreate` | Missing `write_products` scope | Request scope in app config |
| `Product not found` | Wrong GID format | Must be `gid://shopify/Product/1234567890` (numeric ID) |

## Examples

### ProductSet Mutation (Upsert)

```typescript
// productSet creates OR updates — idempotent by handle
const PRODUCT_SET = `
  mutation productSet($input: ProductSetInput!) {
    productSet(input: $input) {
      product { id title }
      userErrors { field message code }
    }
  }
`;

await client.request(PRODUCT_SET, {
  variables: {
    input: {
      title: "Organic Coffee Beans",
      handle: "organic-coffee-beans", // unique identifier
      productType: "Coffee",
      vendor: "Bean Co",
    },
  },
});
```
