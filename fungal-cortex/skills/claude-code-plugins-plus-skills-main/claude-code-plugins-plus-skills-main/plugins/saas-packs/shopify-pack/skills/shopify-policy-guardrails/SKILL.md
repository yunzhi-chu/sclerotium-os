# Shopify Policy & Guardrails

## Overview

Automated policy enforcement for Shopify apps: secret detection, query cost budgets, App Store compliance checks, and CI policy validation.

## Prerequisites

- ESLint configured in project
- Pre-commit hooks infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Shopify app with `shopify.app.toml`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Secret Detection Rules

Custom ESLint rule that catches hardcoded Shopify tokens (`shpat_*`, `shpss_*`) and API secrets in string literals and template literals.

See [Secret Detection ESLint](references/secret-detection-eslint.md) for the complete rule implementation.

### Step 2: Query Cost Budget Enforcement

Static analysis of GraphQL queries enforcing budgets: max 100 items per `first:` param, max 3 levels of nesting, and max 500 estimated cost. Runs at build/test time.

See [Query Cost Budget](references/query-cost-budget.md) for the complete implementation.

### Step 3: Pre-Commit Hooks

Git hooks that scan staged changes for Shopify tokens and block `.env` files from being committed.

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: shopify-token-scan
        name: Scan for Shopify tokens
        language: system
        entry: bash -c '
          if git diff --cached --diff-filter=d | grep -E "shpat_[a-f0-9]{32}|shpss_[a-f0-9]{32}" ; then
            echo "ERROR: Shopify access token detected in staged changes"
            exit 1
          fi'
        pass_filenames: false

      - id: shopify-env-check
        name: Check .env not staged
        language: system
        entry: bash -c '
          if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "^\.env$|^\.env\.local$|^\.env\.production$" ; then
            echo "ERROR: .env file staged for commit"
            exit 1
          fi'
        pass_filenames: false
```

### Step 4: App Store Compliance Checker

Pre-submission script that validates all three GDPR webhooks, token hygiene, CSP headers, and API version stability.

See [Compliance Checker](references/compliance-checker.md) for the complete implementation.

### Step 5: CI Policy Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow enforcing token scanning, GDPR webhook configuration, and API version stability on every push and PR.

See [CI Policy Pipeline](references/ci-policy-pipeline.md) for the complete workflow.

## Output

- ESLint rules catching hardcoded tokens
- Query cost budgets enforced
- Pre-commit hooks blocking secret leaks
- App Store compliance checker
- CI policy pipeline preventing violations

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| False positive on token | Base64 string matched | Narrow regex pattern |
| Query cost estimate wrong | Complex variable nesting | Use actual debug header in tests |
| Pre-commit bypassed | `--no-verify` flag | Enforce in CI as backup |
| App Store rejection | Missing GDPR webhook | Run compliance checker before submit |

## Examples

### Quick Policy Scan

```bash
# One-liner: check for token leaks in staged changes
git diff --cached | grep -E "shpat_|shpss_" && echo "TOKEN LEAK!" || echo "Clean"

# Check GDPR compliance
grep -c "customers/data_request\|customers/redact\|shop/redact" shopify.app.toml
# Should output: 3
```
