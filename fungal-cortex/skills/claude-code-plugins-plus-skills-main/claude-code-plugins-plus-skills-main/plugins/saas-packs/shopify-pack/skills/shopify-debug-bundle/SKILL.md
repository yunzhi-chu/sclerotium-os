# Shopify Debug Bundle

## Overview

Collect all diagnostic information needed for Shopify support tickets: API version compatibility, access scopes, rate limit state, recent errors, and connectivity checks.

## Prerequisites

- Shopify access token (`shpat_xxx`) available
- `curl` and `jq` installed
- Store domain known (`*.myshopify.com`)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create and Run Debug Bundle

The debug bundle script collects shop info, access scopes, supported API versions, GraphQL and REST rate limit state, environment details (Node/npm versions, SDK version, env vars), then packages everything into a tarball with tokens automatically redacted.

See [Debug Bundle Script](references/debug-bundle-script.md) for the complete bash script.

Set these environment variables before running:

```bash
export SHOPIFY_STORE="your-store.myshopify.com"
export SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="shpat_xxx"
export SHOPIFY_API_VERSION="2025-04"  # Update quarterly — see shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/versioning
```

## Output

- `shopify-debug-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz` containing:
  - `summary.txt` — shop info, scopes, API versions, rate limits, environment
  - All secrets automatically redacted

## Error Handling

| Diagnostic | What It Reveals | If It Fails |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Shop info | Store name, plan, timezone | Token invalid or store unreachable |
| Access scopes | What your app can access | Token expired or revoked |
| API versions | Which versions the store supports | Network issue |
| Rate limit state | Current bucket fill level | Token or network issue |
| SDK version | Whether SDK needs updating | Package not installed |

## Examples

### Sensitive Data Checklist

**ALWAYS REDACT before sharing:**

- Access tokens (`shpat_xxx`)
- API keys and secrets
- Customer PII (emails, names, addresses)
- Order details with customer data

**Safe to include:**

- Store name and plan
- API version and scopes
- Error messages and X-Request-Id values
- Rate limit headers
- SDK/runtime versions

### Quick One-Liner Health Check

```bash
curl -sf -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: $SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "https://$SHOPIFY_STORE/admin/api/2025-04/shop.json" \
  | jq '{name: .shop.name, plan: .shop.plan_name}' \
  && echo "HEALTHY" || echo "UNHEALTHY"
```
