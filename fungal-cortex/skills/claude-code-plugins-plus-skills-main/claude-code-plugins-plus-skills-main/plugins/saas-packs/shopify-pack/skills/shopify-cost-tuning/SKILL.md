# Shopify Cost Tuning

## Overview

Optimize Shopify app and API costs through plan analysis, API usage monitoring, and strategies to minimize billable API calls. Covers Shopify store plans, Partner app billing, and API efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Shopify Partner Dashboard for app billing
- Understanding of current API usage patterns
- Knowledge of merchant's Shopify plan

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Shopify Plan Rate Limits

API rate limits are determined by the **merchant's** plan, not your app:

| Merchant Plan | REST Bucket | REST Leak Rate | GraphQL Points | GraphQL Restore |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Basic Shopify | 40 requests | 2/second | 1,000 points | 50/second |
| Shopify | 40 requests | 2/second | 1,000 points | 50/second |
| Advanced | 40 requests | 2/second | 1,000 points | 50/second |
| Shopify Plus | 80 requests | 4/second | 2,000 points | 100/second |

**Key insight:** Upgrading from Basic to Advanced doesn't help rate limits. Only Plus doubles them.

### Step 2: App Billing API

If your app charges merchants, use the GraphQL `appSubscriptionCreate` mutation to create recurring charges. Set `test: true` in development to avoid real billing.

See [App Billing API](references/app-billing-api.md) for the complete mutation and variable setup.

### Step 3: Monitor API Usage

Track GraphQL query costs and REST call counts over time to identify optimization opportunities. Log `extensions.cost.actualQueryCost` from every GraphQL response.

See [Usage Tracker Class](references/usage-tracker-class.md) for a complete tracking implementation with reporting.

### Step 4: Cost Reduction Strategies

Four key strategies: replace REST with GraphQL for targeted field selection, use bulk operations for exports, cache responses and invalidate via webhooks, and use Storefront API for public data.

See [Cost Reduction Strategies](references/cost-reduction-strategies.md) for code examples of each approach.

## Output

- API usage monitored with cost tracking
- Rate limit-efficient query patterns
- App billing configured (if charging merchants)
- Cost reduction strategies applied

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Frequent throttling | High query cost | Reduce fields, use bulk ops |
| High hosting costs | Too many API calls | Cache responses, use webhooks |
| App billing rejection | Test mode not set | Use `test: true` in development |
| Merchant cancels | Unexpected charges | Clear billing in app onboarding |

## Examples

### Quick Usage Check

```typescript
// After every GraphQL call, log the cost
const response = await client.request(query);
const cost = response.extensions?.cost;
if (cost) {
  console.log(
    `Query cost: ${cost.actualQueryCost}/${cost.throttleStatus.maximumAvailable} ` +
    `(${cost.throttleStatus.currentlyAvailable} available)`
  );
}
```
