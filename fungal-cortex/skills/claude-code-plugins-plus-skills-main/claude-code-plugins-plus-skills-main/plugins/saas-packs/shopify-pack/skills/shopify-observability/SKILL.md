# Shopify Observability

## Overview

Instrument your Shopify app to track GraphQL query cost, rate limit consumption, webhook delivery success, and API latency. Shopify-specific metrics that generic monitoring misses.

## Prerequisites

- Prometheus or compatible metrics backend
- pino or similar structured logger
- Shopify API client with response interception

## Instructions

### Step 1: Shopify-Specific Metrics

Define Prometheus counters, histograms, and gauges for query cost, rate limit headroom, REST bucket state, API duration, webhook processing, and error classification.

See [Shopify Metrics Definitions](references/shopify-metrics-definitions.md) for the complete metric registrations.

### Step 2: Instrumented GraphQL Client

Wrap the Shopify GraphQL client to automatically record query cost from `extensions.cost`, update rate limit gauges, and classify errors (throttled, auth, API error).

See [Instrumented GraphQL Client](references/instrumented-graphql-client.md) for the complete implementation.

### Step 3: REST API Header Tracking

Parse `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit` headers (e.g., `"32/40"`) from REST responses to track leaky bucket fill level. Warn when bucket exceeds 80% capacity.

```typescript
function trackRestHeaders(shop: string, headers: Record<string, string>): void {
  const callLimit = headers["x-shopify-shop-api-call-limit"];
  if (callLimit) {
    const [used, max] = callLimit.split("/").map(Number);
    restBucketGauge.set({ shop }, used);
    if (used > max * 0.8) {
      console.warn(`[shopify] REST bucket at ${used}/${max} for ${shop}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Webhook Observability

Track HMAC validation results, processing success/failure, and duration for all incoming webhooks.

See [Webhook Observability](references/webhook-observability.md) for the complete Express middleware.

### Step 5: Structured Logging

Pino-based logger with automatic PII redaction and Shopify-specific context fields (query cost, available points, operation name).

See [Structured Logging](references/structured-logging.md) for the complete implementation.

### Step 6: Alert Rules

Prometheus alert rules for low rate limits, high query cost (P95 > 500), webhook failures (> 10%), and API latency (P95 > 3s).

See [Alert Rules](references/alert-rules.md) for the complete Prometheus configuration.

## Output

- GraphQL query cost tracking with per-operation metrics
- Rate limit monitoring for both REST and GraphQL
- Webhook delivery and processing metrics
- Structured logs with automatic PII redaction
- Alert rules for critical Shopify-specific conditions

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Missing cost data | Query error before response | Check error handling wraps correctly |
| High cardinality | Per-shop labels | Aggregate by plan tier instead |
| Alert storms | Aggressive thresholds | Tune based on baseline traffic |
| Webhook metrics missing | Not instrumented | Add counter to webhook handler |

## Examples

### Metrics Endpoint

```typescript
app.get("/metrics", async (req, res) => {
  res.set("Content-Type", registry.contentType);
  res.send(await registry.metrics());
});
```
