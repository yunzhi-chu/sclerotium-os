# Shopify Rate Limits

## Overview

Shopify uses two distinct rate limiting systems: leaky bucket for REST and calculated query cost for GraphQL. This skill covers both with real header values and response shapes.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Shopify's REST and GraphQL Admin APIs
- Familiarity with the `@shopify/shopify-api` library

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Two Rate Limit Systems

**REST Admin API** -- Leaky Bucket:

| Plan | Bucket Size | Leak Rate |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Standard | 40 requests | 2/second |
| Shopify Plus | 80 requests | 4/second |

The `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit` header shows your bucket state (e.g., `32/40` means 32 of 40 slots used). When full, you get HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header.

**GraphQL Admin API** -- Calculated Query Cost:

| Plan | Max Available | Restore Rate |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Standard | 1,000 points | 50 points/second |
| Shopify Plus | 2,000 points | 100 points/second |

Every GraphQL response includes cost info in `extensions.cost` with `requestedQueryCost` (worst-case estimate), `actualQueryCost` (real cost, often much lower), and `throttleStatus` (available points and restore rate). When `currentlyAvailable` drops to 0, you get `THROTTLED`.

### Step 2: Implement GraphQL Cost-Aware Throttling

Client-side rate limiter that tracks the query cost bucket and pre-emptively waits before sending requests that would be throttled. Updates available points from each response's `throttleStatus`.

See [Cost-Aware Rate Limiter](references/cost-aware-rate-limiter.md) for the complete `ShopifyRateLimiter` class.

### Step 3: Implement Retry with Backoff for 429s

Generic retry wrapper handling both REST 429 responses and GraphQL THROTTLED errors. Uses `Retry-After` header when available, otherwise exponential backoff with jitter (max 30s).

See [Retry with Backoff](references/retry-with-backoff.md) for the complete implementation.

### Step 4: Reduce Query Cost

Prune unused fields and lower `first:` page sizes to reduce `requestedQueryCost`. A query dropping from `first: 250` to `first: 50` with fewer nested fields can go from ~5,500 to ~112 cost.

See [Query Cost Reduction](references/query-cost-reduction.md) for before/after examples and the debug curl command.

## Output

- Rate limit-aware client that prevents 429 errors
- Retry logic with proper backoff for both REST and GraphQL
- Optimized queries with lower calculated cost
- Debug headers for cost analysis

## Error Handling

| Scenario | REST Indicator | GraphQL Indicator |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Approaching limit | `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit: 38/40` | `currentlyAvailable < 100` |
| At limit | HTTP 429 + `Retry-After: 2.0` | `errors[0].extensions.code: "THROTTLED"` |
| Recovering | Wait for `Retry-After` seconds | Wait for `restoreRate` to refill |

## Examples

### Queue-Based Bulk Operations

For large data exports, use Shopify's bulk query API which bypasses rate limits entirely:

```typescript
import PQueue from "p-queue";

const BULK_QUERY = `
  mutation bulkOperationRunQuery($query: String!) {
    bulkOperationRunQuery(query: $query) {
      bulkOperation { id status url }
      userErrors { field message }
    }
  }
`;

await client.request(BULK_QUERY, {
  variables: {
    query: `{
      products {
        edges {
          node {
            id title
            variants { edges { node { id sku price } } }
          }
        }
      }
    }`,
  },
});
```
