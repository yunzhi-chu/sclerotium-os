# TechSmith Webhooks Events

## Overview

Guidance for webhooks events with TechSmith Snagit COM API and Camtasia automation.

## Instructions

### Key Considerations

- Snagit COM API is Windows-only (requires COM registration)
- Camtasia Producer CLI for batch rendering
- PowerShell is the primary scripting language
- Python interop via `pywin32` (`pip install pywin32`)

### Snagit COM Input Types

| Value | Constant | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | siiDesktop | Full desktop |
| 2 | siiRegion | User-selected region |
| 4 | siiWindow | Active window |
| 5 | siiFile | From file |

### Snagit COM Output Types

| Value | Constant | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | sioClipboard | Copy to clipboard |
| 2 | sioFile | Save to file |
| 4 | sioPrinter | Send to printer |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| COM not registered | Snagit not installed | Install and register COM server |
| Permission denied | Not running as admin | Elevate PowerShell |
| File locked | Snagit Editor has file open | Close editor first |
