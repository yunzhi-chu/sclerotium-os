# Langfuse Skill Pack

> Claude Code skill pack for [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) LLM observability -- 24 skills covering tracing, evaluation, prompt management, and production operations.

## What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform providing:

- **Tracing**: End-to-end observability for LLM calls, chains, and agents (OpenTelemetry-based in SDK v4+)
- **Evaluation**: Score outputs with user feedback, automated evals, LLM-as-a-Judge, and dataset experiments
- **Prompt Management**: Version, deploy, and A/B test prompts with labels and variables
- **Analytics**: Monitor costs, latency, and token usage with built-in and custom dashboards
- **Datasets**: Create test sets, run experiments, and track quality regressions
- **Self-hosted or Cloud**: Deploy anywhere or use managed cloud at [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com)

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install langfuse-pack@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

- "Set up evaluation for my LLM app" -> `langfuse-core-workflow-b`
- "Debug this Langfuse error" -> `langfuse-common-errors`
- "Track LLM costs with Langfuse" -> `langfuse-cost-tuning`
- "Migrate from langfuse v3 to v4" -> `langfuse-upgrade-migration`
