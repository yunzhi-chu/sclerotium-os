# Langfuse Incident Runbook

## Overview

Step-by-step procedures for Langfuse-related incidents, from initial triage (2 min) through resolution and post-incident review. Your application should work without Langfuse -- these procedures focus on restoring observability.

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| P1 | Application impacted by tracing | 15 min | SDK throwing unhandled errors, blocking requests |
| P2 | Traces not appearing, no app impact | 1 hour | Missing observability data |
| P3 | Degraded performance from tracing | 4 hours | High latency from flush backlog |
| P4 | Minor issues | 24 hours | Occasional missing traces |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Initial Assessment (2 Minutes)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
echo "=== Langfuse Incident Triage ==="
echo "Time: $(date -u)"

# 1. Check Langfuse cloud status
echo -n "Status page: "
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://status.langfuse.com || echo "UNREACHABLE"
echo ""

# 2. Test API connectivity
HOST="${LANGFUSE_BASE_URL:-${LANGFUSE_HOST:-https://cloud.langfuse.com}}"
echo -n "API health: "
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} (%{time_total}s)" "$HOST/api/public/health" || echo "FAILED"
echo ""

# 3. Test auth
if [ -n "${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY:-}" ] && [ -n "${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY:-}" ]; then
  AUTH=$(echo -n "$LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY:$LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY" | base64)
  echo -n "Auth test: "
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    -H "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" "$HOST/api/public/traces?limit=1" || echo "FAILED"
  echo ""
fi

# 4. Check app error logs
echo ""
echo "--- Recent errors ---"
grep -i "langfuse\|trace.*error\|flush.*fail" /var/log/app/*.log 2>/dev/null | tail -10 || echo "No log files found"
```

### Step 2: Determine Incident Type and Response

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Immediate Action |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| No traces appearing | SDK not flushing | Check shutdown handlers; set `flushAt: 1` temporarily |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Key rotation or mismatch | Verify keys match the correct project |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limited | Increase batch size, reduce flush frequency |
| SDK throwing errors | Unhandled exception | Wrap in try/catch; check SDK version |
| High request latency | Sync flush in hot path | Switch to async; increase `requestTimeout` |
| Complete Langfuse outage | Service-side issue | Enable fallback mode |

### Step 3: Fallback Mode (P1 -- App Impacted)

If Langfuse is causing application issues, disable tracing immediately:

```typescript
// Emergency disable via environment variable
// Set LANGFUSE_ENABLED=false in your deployment

// In your tracing initialization:
if (process.env.LANGFUSE_ENABLED === "false") {
  console.warn("Langfuse tracing DISABLED (emergency fallback)");
  // Don't initialize SDK -- all observe/startActiveObservation calls
  // will still work but produce no-op spans
}
```

For v3, use the `enabled` flag:

```typescript
const langfuse = new Langfuse({
  enabled: process.env.LANGFUSE_ENABLED !== "false",
});
```

### Step 4: Common Resolution Procedures

**Procedure A: Missing Traces**

```typescript
// 1. Verify SDK is initialized
console.log("Langfuse configured:", !!process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY);

// 2. Check flush is happening
// v4+: Verify NodeSDK is started and shutdown is registered
// v3: Verify flushAsync() or shutdownAsync() is called

// 3. Temporarily set aggressive flush for debugging
const processor = new LangfuseSpanProcessor({
  exportIntervalMillis: 1000,
  maxExportBatchSize: 1,
});
```

**Procedure B: Rate Limit (429) Recovery**

```typescript
// Increase batching to reduce API calls
const processor = new LangfuseSpanProcessor({
  exportIntervalMillis: 30000, // 30s flush
  maxExportBatchSize: 200,     // Large batches
});

// Or temporarily enable sampling
const EMERGENCY_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.1; // Only trace 10%
```

**Procedure C: Self-Hosted Instance Down**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep langfuse

# Check logs
docker logs langfuse-langfuse-1 --tail 50

# Check database
docker exec langfuse-postgres-1 pg_isready -U langfuse

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart langfuse
```

### Step 5: Post-Incident Verification

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Verify traces are flowing again
echo "=== Post-Incident Check ==="

HOST="${LANGFUSE_BASE_URL:-https://cloud.langfuse.com}"
AUTH=$(echo -n "$LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY:$LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY" | base64)

# Check recent trace count
TRACE_COUNT=$(curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" \
  "$HOST/api/public/traces?limit=5" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin).get('data',[])))" 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR")

echo "Recent traces: $TRACE_COUNT"

if [ "$TRACE_COUNT" = "0" ] || [ "$TRACE_COUNT" = "ERROR" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Traces may not be flowing yet"
else
  echo "OK: Traces are appearing"
fi
```

### Step 6: Post-Incident Review (P1/P2)

Document for post-mortem:

1. **Timeline**: When detected, when resolved, total duration
2. **Impact**: Traces lost, application impact, user impact
3. **Root cause**: Why did the incident occur?
4. **Resolution**: What fixed it?
5. **Prevention**: What changes prevent recurrence?
6. **Action items**: Improvements to implement

## Escalation Path

| Level | Who | When |
|-------|-----|------|
| L1 | On-call engineer | All incidents -- run triage |
| L2 | Platform team lead | P1/P2 unresolved after 30 min |
| L3 | Langfuse support | Confirmed service-side issue |

**Langfuse support channels:**

- [Status Page](https://status.langfuse.com) -- check first
- [Discord](https://langfuse.com/discord) -- community support
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues) -- bug reports
- Email support (enterprise customers)

## Error Handling

| Issue | Immediate Fix | Permanent Fix |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| SDK crashes app | Set `LANGFUSE_ENABLED=false` | Wrap all tracing in try/catch |
| Lost traces | Increase batch size | Add shutdown handlers |
| High latency | Disable sync flush | Use async-only patterns |
| Auth failures | Rotate and redeploy keys | Add key validation at startup |
