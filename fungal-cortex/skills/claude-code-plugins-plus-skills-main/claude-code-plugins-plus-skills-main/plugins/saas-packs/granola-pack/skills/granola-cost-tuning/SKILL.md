# Granola Cost Tuning

## Overview

Optimize Granola spending with plan selection, ROI analysis, and seat management. Granola pricing is simple: $0 (Basic), $14/user/month (Business), or $35+/user/month (Enterprise). No per-minute charges, no meeting count limits on paid plans, and no hardware device requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Current Granola plan and usage data (Settings > Account)
- Team size and meeting frequency for team deployments
- Budget constraints identified

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Calculate Individual ROI

```
Time savings calculation:
  Meetings per week:           [____]
  Average meeting duration:    [____] min
  Time spent on manual notes:  ~15-20 min per meeting
  Time with Granola:           ~2-3 min per meeting (review + edit)
  Time saved per meeting:      ~15 min

Monthly calculation:
  Meetings per month:          20 (example)
  Time saved:                  20 * 15 min = 300 min = 5 hours
  Your hourly rate:            $60 (example)
  Monthly value of time saved: 5 * $60 = $300

  Granola Business cost:       $14/month
  ROI:                         $300 / $14 = 21x return
  Break-even:                  0.93 meetings/month (~1 meeting)
```

At $14/month, Granola pays for itself if it saves you just one meeting's worth of note-taking per month.

### Step 2 — Select the Right Plan

| Your Situation | Recommended Plan | Monthly Cost |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Trying Granola (< 25 meetings ever) | Basic (Free) | $0 |
| Individual, needs integrations | Business | $14 |
| Team of 2-5, shared folders | Business | $14/user |
| Team of 5-20, needs admin controls | Business | $14/user |
| 20+ users, SSO/SCIM required | Enterprise | $35+/user |
| Regulated industry (SOC 2 audit) | Enterprise | $35+/user |
| Just need transcription, no integrations | Basic (while it lasts) | $0 |

**Cost comparison with competitors (per user/month):**

| Tool | Price | Key Difference |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Granola Business | $14 | No bot, system audio capture |
| Otter.ai Pro | $16.99 | Bot joins meeting |
| Fireflies.ai Pro | $18 | Bot joins meeting |
| tl;dv Pro | $20 | Bot joins meeting |
| Fathom | Free (basic) | Limited features |

Granola's differentiator: no bot joins your meeting, which means no "Granola is recording" banner visible to participants.

### Step 3 — Optimize Team Costs

**Seat audit (monthly):**

1. Settings > Team — review all active seats
2. Identify inactive users (no meetings in 30+ days)
3. Deactivate unused seats — they reduce from next billing cycle
4. Reassign seats to new team members (no extra charge)

**Right-size your deployment:**

```
Team of 10 users:
  All on Business:         10 * $14 = $140/month
  Annual billing (15% off): 10 * $11.90 = $119/month
  Savings:                  $252/year

  Only 7 active users:     7 * $14 = $98/month
  Deactivate 3 inactive:   Save $504/year
```

### Step 4 — Billing Optimization

| Strategy | Savings | How |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Annual billing | 10-15% | Switch in Settings > Billing |
| Remove inactive seats | $14/seat/month | Monthly audit of Settings > Team |
| Enterprise volume discount | 15-30% | Contact sales for 20+ users |
| Multi-year agreement | 20-30% off | Negotiate with Granola sales team |

### Step 5 — Avoid Hidden Costs

Granola itself has no hidden charges, but adjacent costs to budget for:

| Cost | Source | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Zapier tasks | Zapier plan, not Granola | Optimize Zaps, combine steps, use folder triggers (fewer tasks) |
| CRM seat costs | HubSpot/Attio licenses | Granola doesn't require additional CRM seats |
| MCP server hosting | If running custom MCP | Use local cache-based MCP (no hosting needed) |
| Training time | Onboarding hours | Create internal quick-start guide from these skills |

### Step 6 — Build the Business Case

For budget approval, use this template:

```
GRANOLA BUSINESS CASE

Problem:
  - Team spends X hours/week on meeting notes
  - Meeting outcomes are lost (no searchable archive)
  - Action items fall through the cracks

Solution:
  - Granola Business: $14/user/month
  - Team size: [N] users
  - Annual cost: [N * $14 * 12] (or N * $11.90 * 12 with annual)

ROI:
  - Time saved: [N] users * 5 hrs/month = [5N] hrs/month
  - At avg $[X]/hour = $[5N * X]/month value
  - ROI: [value / cost]x
  - Break-even: [cost / (X * 0.25)] meetings (< 1 per user)

Additional Benefits:
  - Searchable meeting history (People & Companies)
  - Automated CRM updates (save sales admin time)
  - Consistent meeting documentation (institutional memory)
  - No meeting bot (no participant friction)
```

## Output

- ROI calculated for individual or team deployment
- Optimal plan selected based on usage and requirements
- Seat management cadence established (monthly audit)
- Business case template prepared for budget approval

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Unexpected bill increase | Seats added without deactivating old ones | Monthly seat audit |
| Zapier cost spike | Too many Zap runs | Batch notifications, use folder triggers instead of per-note |
| Enterprise quote too high | Standard pricing | Negotiate annual commitment for 15-30% discount |
| Free plan exhausted | 25 lifetime meetings used | Upgrade to Business ($14/mo) |
