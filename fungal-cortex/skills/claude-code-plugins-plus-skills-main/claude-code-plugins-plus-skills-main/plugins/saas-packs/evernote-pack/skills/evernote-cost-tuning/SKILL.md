# Evernote Cost Tuning

## Overview

Optimize resource usage and manage costs in Evernote integrations, focusing on monthly upload quotas, storage efficiency, image compression, and account limit monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Evernote account tiers (Basic: 60MB/mo, Premium: 10GB/mo, Business: 20GB/mo)
- Access to user quota information via `user.accounting`
- Monitoring infrastructure for alerts

## Instructions

### Step 1: Quota Monitoring

Query `userStore.getUser()` to access `user.accounting` which contains `uploadLimit`, `uploaded`, and `uploadLimitEnd`. Calculate remaining quota and percentage used.

```javascript
async function getQuotaStatus(userStore) {
  const user = await userStore.getUser();
  const { uploadLimit, uploaded, uploadLimitEnd } = user.accounting;
  return {
    totalMB: Math.round(uploadLimit / 1024 / 1024),
    usedMB: Math.round(uploaded / 1024 / 1024),
    remainingMB: Math.round((uploadLimit - uploaded) / 1024 / 1024),
    percentUsed: Math.round((uploaded / uploadLimit) * 100),
    resetsAt: new Date(uploadLimitEnd)
  };
}
```

### Step 2: Resource Optimization

Compress images before attaching to notes. Resize large images to a maximum dimension (e.g., 1920px). Convert PNG screenshots to JPEG for smaller file sizes. Skip attaching files that exceed the single-note size limit (25MB for Basic, 200MB for Premium).

```javascript
function estimateNoteSize(content, resources = []) {
  const contentBytes = Buffer.byteLength(content, 'utf8');
  const resourceBytes = resources.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.data.size, 0);
  return contentBytes + resourceBytes;
}

function canUpload(noteSize, remainingQuota) {
  return noteSize < remainingQuota;
}
```

### Step 3: Efficient Note Creation

Check quota before creating notes with large attachments. Use `findNotesMetadata()` for read operations (zero upload cost). Batch small notes into single notes where appropriate.

### Step 4: Storage Cleanup

Find large notes consuming quota. List notes sorted by content length to identify optimization candidates. Remove unused resources and delete notes in trash to reclaim space.

### Step 5: Quota Alerts

Send alerts when upload usage exceeds thresholds (e.g., 75%, 90%, 95%). Log quota status after each upload operation for trend analysis.

For the complete quota monitor, image optimizer, cleanup utilities, and alert system, see [Implementation Guide](references/implementation-guide.md).

## Account Limits Reference

| Limit | Basic | Premium | Business |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| Monthly upload | 60 MB | 10 GB | 20 GB/user |
| Single note size | 25 MB | 200 MB | 200 MB |
| Notebooks | 250 | 250 | 10,000 |
| Tags | 100,000 | 100,000 | 100,000 |
| Notes | 100,000 | 100,000 | 500,000 |

## Output

- Quota monitoring service with percentage tracking
- Image compression pipeline for resource optimization
- Pre-upload quota check with size estimation
- Storage cleanup utilities for large notes
- Threshold-based alert system for quota usage

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `QUOTA_REACHED` | Monthly upload limit exceeded | Wait for quota reset at `uploadLimitEnd` |
| `LIMIT_REACHED` | Too many notebooks or tags | Delete unused notebooks, merge duplicate tags |
| `DATA_REQUIRED` | Empty note after optimization | Ensure note still has content after compression |
| `BAD_DATA_FORMAT` | Attachment hash mismatch | Recompute MD5 hash after image compression |

## Examples

**Quota dashboard**: Build a dashboard showing current upload usage (MB used / total), days until reset, largest notes by size, and projected usage based on recent trends.

**Image pipeline**: Before attaching images, resize to max 1920px width, convert PNG to JPEG at 80% quality, check resulting size against remaining quota, and skip if insufficient.
