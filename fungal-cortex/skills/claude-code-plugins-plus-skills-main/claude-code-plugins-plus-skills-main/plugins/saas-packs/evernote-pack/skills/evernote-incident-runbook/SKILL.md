# Evernote Incident Runbook

## Overview

Step-by-step procedures for responding to Evernote integration incidents including API outages, rate limit escalations, authentication failures, data sync issues, and quota exhaustion.

## Prerequisites

- Access to monitoring dashboards and production logs
- Production Evernote API credentials
- Communication channels for escalation (Slack, PagerDuty)

## Instructions

### Incident Classification

| Severity | Symptoms | Response Time |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| P1 - Critical | All Evernote API calls failing, data loss risk | 15 minutes |
| P2 - High | Persistent rate limits, auth failures for multiple users | 1 hour |
| P3 - Medium | Intermittent errors, degraded sync performance | 4 hours |
| P4 - Low | Single user issues, non-critical feature affected | Next business day |

### Step 1: Triage

Check Evernote's status page first. If Evernote is down, activate the circuit breaker and wait.

```bash
# Check Evernote service status
curl -sf https://status.evernote.com/api/v2/status.json | jq '.status'

# Check your API connectivity
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $EVERNOTE_TOKEN" \
  https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/notestore | head -20

# Check error rate in logs (last 15 min)
grep -c 'EDAMSystemException' /var/log/evernote-app.log
```

### Step 2: Rate Limit Escalation

If rate limits are persistent: reduce API call frequency, increase delays between batch operations, and contact Evernote developer support for a rate limit increase.

### Step 3: Authentication Failure

For auth failures: verify tokens are not expired (`edam_expires`), check that production credentials match the production endpoint (`sandbox: false`), and test with a fresh Developer Token to isolate the issue.

### Step 4: Sync Failure Recovery

For sync issues: compare local USN with server USN via `getSyncState()`. If gap is too large, reset to full sync from USN 0. Verify data integrity after re-sync.

### Step 5: Mitigation Strategies

- **Circuit breaker**: Disable Evernote API calls after N consecutive failures. Retry after cooldown period.
- **Graceful degradation**: Serve cached data when API is unavailable. Queue writes for retry.
- **Failover**: Switch to polling-based sync if webhooks stop arriving.

### Post-Incident

- Document root cause and timeline
- Update runbook with new failure modes discovered
- Adjust alert thresholds if false positive or missed detection
- Review and improve circuit breaker settings

For the complete diagnostic scripts, mitigation implementations, and communication templates, see [Implementation Guide](references/implementation-guide.md).

## Output

- Incident severity classification table
- Triage diagnostic commands for quick assessment
- Rate limit, auth, and sync failure response procedures
- Circuit breaker and graceful degradation patterns
- Post-incident review checklist

## Error Handling

| Incident Type | Diagnostic | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| API outage | Check `status.evernote.com` | Activate circuit breaker, serve cached data |
| Rate limit storm | Check `evernote_rate_limits_total` metric | Reduce batch sizes, increase delays |
| Mass auth failure | Verify token expiration dates in DB | Trigger re-auth flow for affected users |
| Sync data loss | Compare local vs server note counts | Full re-sync from USN 0 |

## Next Steps

For data handling best practices, see `evernote-data-handling`.

## Examples

**API outage response**: Alert fires, on-call checks status page, confirms Evernote outage, activates circuit breaker, posts status update to internal Slack, monitors for recovery, then gradually re-enables API calls.

**Rate limit recovery**: Persistent `RATE_LIMIT_REACHED` errors detected. Reduce batch size from 100 to 10, increase delay to 500ms, clear the request queue, and contact Evernote support if limits continue after 1 hour.
