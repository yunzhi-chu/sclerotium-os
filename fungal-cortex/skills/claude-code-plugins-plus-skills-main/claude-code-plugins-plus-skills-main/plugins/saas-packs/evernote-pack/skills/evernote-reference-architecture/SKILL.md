# Evernote Reference Architecture

## Overview

Production-ready architecture patterns for building scalable, maintainable Evernote integrations. Covers service layer design, caching strategy, sync architecture, and deployment topology.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of microservices or modular monolith architecture
- Cloud platform familiarity (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Knowledge of message queues and caching

## Instructions

### Architecture Layers

```
Client Layer    [Web App / Mobile / CLI]
                        |
API Layer       [Express/Fastify REST API]
                        |
Service Layer   [NoteService | SearchService | SyncService]
                        |
Integration     [EvernoteClient (rate-limited, instrumented)]
                        |
Infrastructure  [Redis Cache | PostgreSQL | Message Queue]
```

### Service Layer Design

Separate concerns into focused services:

- **NoteService**: CRUD operations, ENML formatting, tag management
- **SearchService**: Query building, pagination, result enrichment
- **SyncService**: Webhook handling, incremental sync, conflict resolution
- **AuthService**: OAuth flow, token storage, refresh logic

```javascript
// services/index.js - Service registry
class ServiceRegistry {
  constructor(noteStore, cache, db) {
    this.notes = new NoteService(noteStore);
    this.search = new SearchService(noteStore, cache);
    this.sync = new SyncService(noteStore, db);
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy

Cache at two levels: in-memory LRU for hot data (note metadata, user info) and Redis for shared state (notebook lists, tag lists, sync checkpoints). Invalidate on webhook notification.

### Sync Architecture

Use webhooks as the primary change notification channel. Fall back to polling when webhooks are unavailable. Process changes through a message queue for reliability and retry. Store sync state (USN) in the database for crash recovery.

```
Evernote Webhook → API Gateway → Message Queue → Sync Worker → Database
                                                      ↓
                                              Evernote API (fetch changes)
```

### Database Schema

Store mirrored Evernote data locally for fast reads. Key tables: `users` (token, expiration), `notebooks`, `notes` (content, metadata), `tags`, `resources` (metadata, file path), `sync_state` (user_id, last_usn).

For the complete architecture diagrams, service implementations, database schema, and scaling guidelines, see [Implementation Guide](references/implementation-guide.md).

## Output

- Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Service registry pattern for dependency management
- Two-level caching strategy (in-memory + Redis)
- Webhook-first sync architecture with polling fallback
- Database schema for local data mirroring
- Message queue integration for reliable event processing

## Error Handling

| Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Evernote API outage | All sync stops | Circuit breaker, serve cached data |
| Redis down | Increased API call rate | Fall through to direct API, in-memory fallback |
| Database failure | Cannot persist sync state | Queue events, replay after recovery |
| Message queue failure | Webhook events lost | Polling fallback, periodic full sync |

## Next Steps

For multi-environment setup, see `evernote-multi-env-setup`.

## Examples

**Note-taking SaaS**: Build a web app where users connect their Evernote account via OAuth, sync notes to a local database, provide full-text search via PostgreSQL, and push changes back to Evernote.

**Team dashboard**: Aggregate notes from multiple Evernote Business users into a shared dashboard. Use the sync architecture to keep data fresh. Cache notebook/tag lookups for sub-100ms response times.
