# Building API Authentication

## Overview

Build secure API authentication systems supporting JWT Bearer tokens, OAuth 2.0 authorization code and client credentials flows, API key management, and session-based authentication. Implement token issuance, validation, refresh rotation, revocation, and role-based access control (RBAC) with scoped permissions across all API endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Cryptographic library: `jsonwebtoken` (Node.js), `PyJWT` (Python), or `jjwt` (Java)
- Secure secret storage: environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault for JWT signing keys
- Database table for user credentials, refresh tokens, and API key storage
- Bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing (never store plaintext passwords)
- OAuth 2.0 provider credentials for third-party auth integration (Google, GitHub, Auth0)

## Instructions

1. Examine existing authentication setup using Grep and Read, identifying current auth mechanisms, middleware placement, and any endpoints bypassing authentication.
2. Implement JWT token issuance on successful login: sign with RS256 (asymmetric) or HS256 (symmetric), including `sub` (user ID), `iat`, `exp` (15-minute access token), `roles`, and `scopes` in the payload.
3. Create authentication middleware that extracts the Bearer token from the `Authorization` header, verifies the signature and expiration, and injects the decoded user context into the request object.
4. Implement refresh token rotation: issue a long-lived refresh token (30 days) alongside the access token, store a hash of the refresh token in the database, and rotate on each refresh (invalidating the previous token).
5. Build role-based access control (RBAC) middleware that checks `user.roles` against endpoint-required roles, supporting both role-level (`admin`, `user`) and scope-level (`read:users`, `write:orders`) authorization.
6. Add API key authentication as an alternative to JWT for machine-to-machine communication: generate cryptographically random keys, store hashed values, and validate against the `X-API-Key` header.
7. Implement OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for service-to-service authentication, with token caching and automatic renewal before expiration.
8. Add brute-force protection on login endpoints: rate limit to 5 attempts per minute per IP, implement progressive lockout (15 min, 1 hour) after repeated failures, and log all authentication attempts.
9. Write security tests covering: valid/invalid/expired tokens, refresh token rotation, role enforcement, API key validation, brute-force lockout, and token revocation.

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md` for the full implementation guide.

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Token Expired | JWT `exp` claim is in the past | Client should attempt token refresh; if refresh fails, redirect to login |
| 401 Invalid Signature | JWT signed with different key or tampered payload | Verify signing key matches between issuance and validation; check for key rotation issues |
| 403 Insufficient Scope | Authenticated user lacks required role/scope for endpoint | Return required scope in error body; log authorization failure with user and endpoint details |
| Refresh token reuse | Previously rotated refresh token used (possible token theft) | Invalidate all user sessions immediately; alert user of potential compromise; require re-authentication |
| API key leaked | API key exposed in client-side code, logs, or version control | Revoke compromised key immediately; issue replacement; scan for exposure source |

Refer to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/errors.md` for comprehensive error patterns.

## Examples

**JWT with refresh rotation**: Login returns `{accessToken (15min), refreshToken (30d)}`; client stores refresh token securely; on 401, client calls `POST /auth/refresh` with old refresh token, receives new pair, old refresh token is invalidated.

**Multi-provider OAuth**: Support "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with GitHub" using OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, creating local user accounts on first sign-in and linking subsequent provider connections.

**API key with scoped permissions**: Generate API keys with specific scopes (`read:analytics`, `write:webhooks`), stored as SHA-256 hashes, displayed to the user only once at creation, with key rotation support.

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/examples.md` for additional examples.
