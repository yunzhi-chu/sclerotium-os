"""
Template for a basic WebSocket server using native WebSockets.

This script provides a foundation for building real-time bidirectional
communication applications using Python's built-in `websockets` library.
It includes basic connection handling, message reception, and sending.

Example usage:
1. Install the `websockets` library: `pip install websockets`
2. Run the script: `python template_native_ws.py`
3. Connect to the server using a WebSocket client (e.g., a browser-based client).
