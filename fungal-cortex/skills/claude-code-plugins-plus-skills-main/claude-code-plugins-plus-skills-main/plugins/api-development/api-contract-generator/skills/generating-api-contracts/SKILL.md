# Generating API Contracts

## Overview

Generate OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 specifications and consumer-driven contract tests from existing API implementations, design documents, or database schemas. Produce machine-readable contracts that serve as the single source of truth for code generation, documentation, testing, and gateway configuration, with Pact integration for consumer-driven contract verification.

## Prerequisites

- API implementation with route definitions and handler logic, or design requirements document
- OpenAPI authoring tool: Swagger Editor, Stoplight Studio, or IDE with OpenAPI extension
- Consumer-driven contract framework: Pact (polyglot), Spring Cloud Contract (Java), or Dredd (generic)
- Schema validation tool: Spectral for OpenAPI linting
- Version control for contract files with diff-based review process

## Instructions

1. Scan existing route handlers and controller files using Grep and Read to extract all endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request parameter names/types, and response body shapes.
2. Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification from the extracted data, including `info` (title, version, description), `servers` (environment URLs), `paths` (operations), and `components` (reusable schemas).
3. Define request schemas with field-level constraints: `type`, `format`, `required`, `minimum/maximum`, `pattern` (regex), `enum`, and `example` values for every property.
4. Document all response status codes per endpoint with separate schemas: 200/201 for success, 400 for validation errors (with field-level error array), 401/403 for auth failures, and 404/500.
5. Add security scheme definitions (`bearerAuth`, `apiKey`, `oauth2`) and apply them to appropriate operations using the `security` field.
6. Create Pact consumer contract tests that capture expected interactions from the API consumer perspective, defining expected request/response pairs per endpoint.
7. Set up provider verification that replays Pact interactions against the actual API implementation, verifying the provider satisfies all consumer expectations.
8. Generate contract artifacts: OpenAPI spec file, Postman collection, and consumer contract (Pact JSON), all versioned alongside the API source code.

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implementation.md` for the full implementation guide.

## Output

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/openapi.yaml` - Complete OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 specification
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/contracts/pact/` - Consumer-driven contract definitions (Pact JSON)
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/contracts/postman/` - Generated Postman collection for API testing
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tests/contract/consumer/` - Consumer contract test implementations
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tests/contract/provider/` - Provider verification test suite
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/generate-contract.sh` - Contract generation automation script

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Spec-code divergence | API implementation changed without updating the OpenAPI spec | Add CI check that generates spec from code and diffs against committed spec |
| Pact verification failure | Provider response does not match consumer expectation | Review consumer contract for correctness; update provider if contract is valid |
| Missing operation ID | Endpoint has no `operationId`, preventing code generation | Generate deterministic operation IDs from method + path (e.g., `getUsers`, `createUser`) |
| Circular schema reference | Components reference each other creating infinite recursion | Break cycles with `allOf` composition or introduce intermediate types |
| Example/schema mismatch | Example values do not validate against their own schema | Auto-validate all examples during spec generation; reject mismatched examples |

Refer to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/errors.md` for comprehensive error patterns.

## Examples

**Code-first OpenAPI generation**: Scan Express route decorators and Zod validation schemas to auto-generate a complete OpenAPI 3.1 spec with accurate request/response schemas, examples, and descriptions.

**Consumer-driven contract testing**: Frontend team publishes Pact contracts defining the API interactions they depend on; backend CI verifies every contract on each deployment, preventing breaking changes.

**Design-first workflow**: Author OpenAPI spec in Stoplight Studio, generate server stubs and client SDKs from the spec, then implement business logic in the stubs -- spec stays as the single source of truth.

See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/examples.md` for additional examples.
