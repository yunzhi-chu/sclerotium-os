# Distributed Tracing Setup

Set up distributed tracing for microservices using OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, or Zipkin with context propagation, span creation, and trace collection configuration.

## Overview

This skill streamlines the process of setting up distributed tracing in a microservices environment. It guides you through the key steps of instrumenting your services, configuring trace context propagation, and selecting a backend for trace collection and analysis, enabling comprehensive monitoring and debugging.

## How It Works

1. **Backend Selection**: Determines the preferred tracing backend (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog).
2. **Instrumentation Strategy**: Designs an instrumentation strategy for each service, focusing on key operations and dependencies.
3. **Configuration Generation**: Generates the necessary configuration files and code snippets to enable distributed tracing.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Implement distributed tracing in a microservices application.
- Gain end-to-end visibility into request flows across multiple services.
- Troubleshoot performance bottlenecks and latency issues.

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding Tracing to a New Microservice

User request: "setup tracing for the new payment service"

The skill will:

1. Prompt for the preferred tracing backend (e.g., Jaeger).
2. Generate code snippets for OpenTelemetry instrumentation in the payment service.

### Example 2: Troubleshooting Performance Issues

User request: "implement distributed tracing to debug slow checkout process"

The skill will:

1. Guide the user through instrumenting relevant services in the checkout flow.
2. Provide configuration examples for context propagation.

## Best Practices

- **Backend Choice**: Select a tracing backend that aligns with your existing infrastructure and monitoring tools.
- **Sampling Strategy**: Implement a sampling strategy to manage trace volume and cost, especially in high-traffic environments.
- **Context Propagation**: Ensure proper context propagation across all services to maintain trace continuity.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other plugins to automate the deployment and configuration of tracing infrastructure. For example, it can integrate with infrastructure-as-code tools to provision Jaeger or Zipkin clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Appropriate file access permissions
- Required dependencies installed

## Instructions

1. Invoke this skill when the trigger conditions are met
2. Provide necessary context and parameters
3. Review the generated output
4. Apply modifications as needed

## Output

The skill produces structured output relevant to the task.
