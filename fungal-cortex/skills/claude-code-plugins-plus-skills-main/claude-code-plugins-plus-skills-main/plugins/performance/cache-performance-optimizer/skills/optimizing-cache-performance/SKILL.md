# Cache Performance Optimizer

Analyze and optimize caching strategies for Redis, Memcached, and in-memory caches by tuning hit rates, TTL configurations, key design, and invalidation policies.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to diagnose and resolve caching-related performance issues. It guides users through a comprehensive optimization process, ensuring efficient use of caching resources.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Caching Implementation**: Locates the caching implementation within the project (e.g., Redis, Memcached, in-memory caches).
2. **Analyze Cache Configuration**: Examines the existing cache configuration, including TTL values, eviction policies, and key structures.
3. **Recommend Optimizations**: Suggests improvements to cache hit rates, TTLs, key design, invalidation strategies, and memory usage.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Improve application performance by optimizing caching mechanisms.
- Identify and resolve caching-related bottlenecks.
- Review and improve cache key design for better hit rates.

## Examples

### Example 1: Optimizing Redis Cache

User request: "Optimize Redis cache performance."

The skill will:

1. Analyze the Redis configuration, including TTLs and memory usage.
2. Recommend optimal TTL values based on data access patterns.

### Example 2: Improving Cache Hit Rate

User request: "Improve cache hit rate in my application."

The skill will:

1. Analyze cache key design and identify potential areas for improvement.
2. Suggest more effective cache key structures to increase hit rates.

## Best Practices

- **TTL Management**: Set appropriate TTL values to balance data freshness and cache hit rates.
- **Key Design**: Use consistent and well-structured cache keys for efficient retrieval.
- **Invalidation Strategies**: Implement proper cache invalidation strategies to avoid serving stale data.

## Integration

This skill can integrate with code analysis tools to automatically identify caching implementations and configuration. It can also work with monitoring tools to track cache hit rates and performance metrics.
