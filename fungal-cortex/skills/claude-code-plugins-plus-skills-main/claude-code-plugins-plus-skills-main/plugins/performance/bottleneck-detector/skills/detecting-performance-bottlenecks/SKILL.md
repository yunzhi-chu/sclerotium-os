# Bottleneck Detector

Detect and diagnose performance bottlenecks across CPU, memory, I/O, database, and lock contention layers with targeted remediation strategies.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to identify and address performance bottlenecks across different layers of an application. By pinpointing performance issues in CPU, memory, I/O, and database operations, it assists in optimizing resource utilization and improving overall application speed and responsiveness.

## How It Works

1. **Architecture Analysis**: Claude analyzes the application's architecture and data flow to understand potential bottlenecks.
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: The plugin identifies bottlenecks across CPU, memory, I/O, database, lock contention, and resource exhaustion.
3. **Remediation Suggestions**: Claude provides remediation strategies with code examples to resolve the identified bottlenecks.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Diagnose slow application performance.
- Optimize resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, database).
- Proactively prevent performance issues.

## Examples

### Example 1: Diagnosing Slow Database Queries

User request: "detect bottlenecks in my database queries"

The skill will:

1. Analyze database query performance and identify slow-running queries.
2. Suggest optimizations like indexing or query rewriting to improve database performance.

### Example 2: Identifying Memory Leaks

User request: "analyze performance and find memory leaks"

The skill will:

1. Profile memory usage patterns to identify potential memory leaks.
2. Provide code examples and recommendations to fix the memory leaks.

## Best Practices

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Always analyze all potential bottleneck areas (CPU, memory, I/O, database) for a complete picture.
- **Prioritize by Severity**: Focus on addressing the most severe bottlenecks first for maximum impact.
- **Test Thoroughly**: After implementing remediation strategies, thoroughly test the application to ensure the bottlenecks are resolved and no new issues are introduced.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with code generation plugins to automatically implement the suggested remediation strategies. It also integrates with monitoring and logging tools to provide real-time performance data.
