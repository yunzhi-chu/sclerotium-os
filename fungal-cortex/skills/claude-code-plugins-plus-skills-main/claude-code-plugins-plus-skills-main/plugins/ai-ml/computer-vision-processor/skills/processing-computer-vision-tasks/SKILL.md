# Computer Vision Processor

Process images using object detection, classification, and segmentation pipelines with configurable model backends.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to leverage the computer-vision-processor plugin to analyze images, detect objects, and extract meaningful information. It automates computer vision workflows, optimizes performance, and provides detailed insights based on image content.

## How It Works

1. **Analyzing the Request**: Claude identifies the need for computer vision processing based on the user's request and trigger terms.
2. **Generating Code**: Claude generates the appropriate Python code to interact with the computer-vision-processor plugin, specifying the desired analysis type (e.g., object detection, image classification).
3. **Executing the Task**: The generated code is executed using the `/process-vision` command, which processes the image and returns the results.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:

- Analyze an image for specific objects or features.
- Classify an image into predefined categories.
- Segment an image to identify different regions or objects.

## Examples

### Example 1: Object Detection

User request: "Analyze this image and identify all the cars and pedestrians."

The skill will:

1. Generate code to perform object detection on the provided image using the computer-vision-processor plugin.
2. Return a list of bounding boxes and labels for each detected car and pedestrian.

### Example 2: Image Classification

User request: "Classify this image. Is it a cat or a dog?"

The skill will:

1. Generate code to perform image classification on the provided image using the computer-vision-processor plugin.
2. Return the classification result (e.g., "cat" or "dog") along with a confidence score.

## Best Practices

- **Data Validation**: Always validate the input image to ensure it's in a supported format and resolution.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage potential issues during image processing.
- **Performance Optimization**: Choose the appropriate computer vision techniques and parameters to optimize performance for the specific task.

## Integration

This skill utilizes the `/process-vision` command provided by the computer-vision-processor plugin. It can be integrated with other skills to further process the results of the computer vision analysis, such as generating reports or triggering actions based on detected objects.

## Prerequisites

- Appropriate file access permissions
- Required dependencies installed

## Instructions

1. Invoke this skill when the trigger conditions are met
2. Provide necessary context and parameters
3. Review the generated output
4. Apply modifications as needed

## Output
