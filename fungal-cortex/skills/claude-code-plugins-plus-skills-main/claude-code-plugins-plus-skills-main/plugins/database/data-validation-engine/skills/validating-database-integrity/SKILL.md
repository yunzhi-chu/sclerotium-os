# Data Validation Engine

## Overview

Implement and enforce data integrity rules at the database level using CHECK constraints, triggers, foreign keys, and custom validation functions across PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## Prerequisites

- Database credentials with ALTER TABLE and CREATE FUNCTION permissions
- `psql` or `mysql` CLI for executing validation queries
- Current schema documentation or access to `information_schema` for column specifications
- Business rules document describing valid data ranges, formats, and relationships
- Backup of production data before applying new constraints (constraints may reject existing invalid data)

## Instructions

1. Audit existing data quality by running validation queries before adding constraints. Check for NULL values in columns that should be required: `SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NULL) AS null_count, COUNT(*) AS total FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name`.

2. Detect orphaned records (broken referential integrity): `SELECT c.id FROM child_table c LEFT JOIN parent_table p ON c.parent_id = p.id WHERE p.id IS NULL`. Document all orphaned records for cleanup or archival before adding foreign key constraints.

3. Validate data format compliance:
   - Email format: `SELECT email FROM users WHERE email !~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'`
   - Phone format: `SELECT phone FROM contacts WHERE phone !~ '^\+?[1-9]\d{6,14}$'`
   - URL format: `SELECT url FROM links WHERE url !~ '^https?://.+'`
   - Date ranges: `SELECT * FROM events WHERE start_date > end_date`

4. Check numeric range violations: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 0 OR price > 999999.99` and `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age < 0 OR age > 150`. Map each column to its valid range based on business rules.

5. Identify duplicate records that violate intended uniqueness: `SELECT email, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`. Determine which duplicate to keep (most recent, most complete) and plan deduplication.

6. Generate CHECK constraints for validated rules:
   - `ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT chk_price_positive CHECK (price >= 0)`
   - `ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT chk_email_format CHECK (email ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$')`
   - `ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT chk_date_order CHECK (start_date <= end_date)`
   - `ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT chk_status_valid CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled'))`

7. Create foreign key constraints with appropriate cascade behavior:
   - `ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT`
   - Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for dependent data (order_items when order is deleted)
   - Use `ON DELETE SET NULL` for optional relationships (assigned_to when user is deactivated)

8. Implement complex business rule validation using database triggers when CHECK constraints are insufficient:
   - Trigger that prevents order total from exceeding customer credit limit
   - Trigger that enforces at least one admin user per organization
   - Trigger that validates JSON schema for JSONB columns

9. Apply constraints in a safe two-phase approach:
   - Phase 1: Run validation queries to find all violations. Generate data cleanup scripts. Execute cleanup.
   - Phase 2: Apply constraints with `NOT VALID` option (PostgreSQL): `ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT chk_email CHECK (email ~ '...') NOT VALID` then `ALTER TABLE users VALIDATE CONSTRAINT chk_email` (validates existing data without blocking writes).

10. Generate a data quality report summarizing: total records per table, violation counts by constraint type, cleanup actions taken, constraints applied, and remaining data quality issues requiring manual review.

## Output

- **Data quality audit report** with violation counts, examples, and severity ratings
- **Data cleanup scripts** (SQL) to fix violations before constraint application
- **Constraint DDL scripts** with CHECK, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE constraints
- **Validation triggers** for complex business rules beyond simple constraints
- **Ongoing validation queries** for periodic data quality monitoring

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `check constraint violated by existing row` | Existing data fails the new constraint | Run the validation query first to find violations; clean up data; use `NOT VALID` option to add constraint without checking existing data, then validate separately |
| `cannot add foreign key: referenced row not found` | Orphaned child records reference non-existent parent | Clean up orphaned records first with DELETE or UPDATE to valid parent; or insert missing parent records |
| `column cannot be made NOT NULL: contains NULL values` | Existing rows have NULL in the target column | Backfill NULLs with `UPDATE table SET column = default_value WHERE column IS NULL` before adding NOT NULL |
| Trigger function causes performance regression | Complex validation logic executes on every INSERT/UPDATE | Optimize trigger function; use WHEN clause to limit trigger firing; consider CHECK constraints instead of triggers for simple rules |
| Circular foreign key prevents constraint creation | Tables reference each other, preventing creation order | Use `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT` after both tables exist; or use `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` constraints |

## Examples

**Auditing a legacy database with 50,000 invalid email addresses**: Validation query reveals 50,000 of 2M user records have invalid email formats (missing @, double dots, spaces). A cleanup script normalizes common issues (trim whitespace, lowercase) and flags 3,000 unfixable records for manual review. After cleanup, a CHECK constraint with regex validation is applied.

**Enforcing referential integrity on a database without foreign keys**: An application relied on application-level FK enforcement, resulting in 12,000 orphaned order_items, 800 orphaned payments, and 200 orphaned reviews. Cleanup scripts archive orphaned records to backup tables, then foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE` are added. A nightly validation job monitors for new orphans.

**Implementing business rules for a financial application**: Constraints enforce: account balance cannot be negative (`CHECK (balance >= 0)`), transfer amount must be positive (`CHECK (amount > 0)`), transaction date cannot be in the future (`CHECK (transaction_date <= CURRENT_DATE)`), and a trigger prevents transfers between accounts owned by different customers unless explicitly authorized.
