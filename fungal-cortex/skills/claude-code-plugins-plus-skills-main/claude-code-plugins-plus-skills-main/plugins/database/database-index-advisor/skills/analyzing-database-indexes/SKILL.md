## Overview

Analyze database index usage, identify missing indexes causing sequential scans, detect redundant or unused indexes wasting write performance, and recommend optimal index configurations for PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## Prerequisites

- Database credentials with access to `pg_stat_user_indexes`, `pg_stat_user_tables`, and `pg_stat_statements` (PostgreSQL) or `performance_schema` and `sys` schema (MySQL)
- `pg_stat_statements` extension enabled for PostgreSQL query statistics
- `psql` or `mysql` CLI for executing analysis queries
- Representative workload running (analysis during off-peak hours may miss important query patterns)
- At least 24 hours of statistics accumulation since the last `pg_stat_reset()`

## Instructions

1. Identify tables with high sequential scan activity (candidates for missing indexes):
   - PostgreSQL: `SELECT relname, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, idx_scan, n_live_tup FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE seq_scan > 100 AND n_live_tup > 10000 ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC LIMIT 20`
   - A table with high `seq_scan` count and high `seq_tup_read` relative to `n_live_tup` is scanning most of the table repeatedly

2. Find the queries causing sequential scans by correlating with `pg_stat_statements`:
   - `SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, rows FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%table_name%' ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10`
   - Run `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on the top queries to confirm sequential scan usage

3. Analyze query WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions to determine which columns need indexes. Extract the filtering columns and their selectivity:
   - `SELECT column_name, n_distinct, correlation FROM pg_stats WHERE tablename = 'target_table'`
   - High `n_distinct` (close to row count) indicates good index selectivity
   - `correlation` close to 1.0 or -1.0 suggests the column benefits from a B-tree index

4. Recommend composite indexes for multi-column queries. Follow the equality-first, range-second ordering:
   - Place columns used with `=` operators first in the index
   - Place columns used with `>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`, or `LIKE 'prefix%'` last
   - Example: `WHERE status = 'active' AND created_at > '2024-01-01'` -> `CREATE INDEX ON orders (status, created_at)`

5. Identify unused indexes wasting write performance:
   - PostgreSQL: `SELECT indexrelname, idx_scan, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0 AND indexrelname NOT LIKE '%pkey' ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC`
   - Indexes with zero scans over a representative period are candidates for removal (verify they are not used by foreign key constraints or unique enforcement)

6. Detect redundant indexes where one index is a prefix of another:
   - A single-column index on `(customer_id)` is redundant if a composite index on `(customer_id, created_at)` exists, because the composite index serves both single-column and multi-column queries
   - Generate DROP INDEX recommendations for the redundant subset indexes

7. Evaluate partial indexes for filtered queries. If a query always filters `WHERE status = 'active'`:
   - `CREATE INDEX idx_orders_active ON orders (created_at) WHERE status = 'active'`
   - Partial indexes are smaller and faster than full indexes when the filter eliminates most rows

8. Consider covering indexes (INCLUDE clause in PostgreSQL 11+) for index-only scans:
   - `CREATE INDEX idx_orders_covering ON orders (customer_id, created_at) INCLUDE (total_amount, status)`
   - The INCLUDE columns are stored in the index leaf pages, enabling index-only scans without heap access

9. Estimate the impact of each recommendation:
   - Index size: `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('index_name'))` for existing similar indexes
   - Write overhead: each additional index adds approximately 5-15% write latency per INSERT/UPDATE
   - Read improvement: compare EXPLAIN plans with and without the proposed index

10. Generate a prioritized recommendations report with CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX statements, estimated storage impact, expected query improvement, and write overhead trade-off analysis.

## Output

- **Missing index recommendations** as ready-to-execute CREATE INDEX statements with CONCURRENTLY option
- **Unused index report** with DROP INDEX candidates and their storage savings
- **Redundant index report** identifying prefix-overlapping indexes
- **Index usage statistics** showing scan counts, tuple reads, and sizes for all indexes
- **Impact analysis** estimating read improvement vs. write overhead for each recommendation

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `pg_stat_statements` not available | Extension not installed | `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements` and add to `shared_preload_libraries` |
| Index creation blocks writes | `CREATE INDEX` acquires exclusive lock on the table | Use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` which does not block writes (takes longer but safe for production) |
| Index not used after creation | Statistics not updated or query planner choosing sequential scan | Run `ANALYZE table_name`; check `random_page_cost` setting (reduce to 1.1 for SSD); verify query uses indexed columns without functions |
| Statistics reset unexpectedly | `pg_stat_reset()` called or database restart cleared stats | Wait 24-48 hours for statistics to accumulate; set up periodic stats collection to a metrics table |
| Too many indexes on write-heavy table | Each INSERT/UPDATE must update all indexes | Target 5-7 indexes per table maximum; use composite indexes to replace multiple single-column indexes; remove unused indexes |

## Examples

**Identifying a missing composite index for an API endpoint**: The `/orders?customer_id=123&status=active` endpoint takes 2 seconds. Analysis shows the orders table (5M rows) has indexes on `(id)` and `(customer_id)` but not `(customer_id, status)`. The query filters on both columns. Adding `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_customer_status ON orders (customer_id, status)` reduces the query to 5ms.

**Cleaning up 8 unused indexes saving 12GB**: Index usage analysis reveals 8 indexes with zero scans over 30 days, totaling 12GB of storage. After confirming none are used for FK enforcement or unique constraints, dropping them reduces write latency by 18% and frees disk space. Command: `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_name`.

**Replacing 3 single-column indexes with 1 composite covering index**: Table has separate indexes on `(user_id)`, `(created_at)`, and `(status)`. Most queries filter on all three. A single composite index `(user_id, status, created_at) INCLUDE (amount)` replaces all three, reduces total index storage by 40%, and enables index-only scans for the dashboard query.
