## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd plugins/mcp/ai-experiment-logger

```bash
pnpm build
```

### 3. Configure MCP Server

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration file (`~/.claude/mcp_config.json`):

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-experiment-logger": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/plugins/mcp/ai-experiment-logger/dist/index.js"
      ]
    }

### 4. Restart Claude Code

Restart Claude Code to load the MCP server.

## Usage

### Using MCP Tools (in Claude Code)

#### Log an Experiment

```
Use the log_experiment tool to record:
- AI Tool: "ChatGPT o1-preview"
- Prompt: "Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers recursively"
- Result: "Provided clean recursive implementation with base cases. Included time complexity analysis (O(2^n))."
- Rating: 4
- Tags: ["code-generation", "python", "algorithms"]
```

#### List Recent Experiments

```
Use the list_experiments tool to show my last 10 experiments
```

#### Search Experiments

```
Use the list_experiments tool with searchQuery="code-generation" to find all coding experiments
```

#### Get Statistics

```
Use the get_statistics tool to show me which AI tools perform best
```

#### Export Data

```
Use the export_experiments tool to generate a CSV file of all my experiments
```

### Using the Web Dashboard

#### Start the Web Server

```bash
cd plugins/mcp/ai-experiment-logger
pnpm web
```

The web UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Web Dashboard Features

1. **Dashboard Tab**
   - View all experiments in a sortable table
   - Search across all fields in real-time
   - Filter by AI tool, rating, or date range
   - Delete experiments with confirmation

2. **Statistics Tab**
   - Total experiments and average rating
   - AI tool performance comparison
   - Rating distribution visualization
   - Top tags analysis
   - Recent activity chart (30 days)

3. **Log Experiment Button**
   - Easy form with all fields
   - Star rating selector (1-5)
   - Tag management (comma-separated)
   - Date/time picker (defaults to now)

4. **Export CSV Button**
   - Download all experiments as CSV
   - Compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, etc.
   - Includes all metadata

## Data Storage

Experiments are stored locally in JSON format:

- **Location:** `~/.ai-experiment-logger/experiments.json`
- **Format:** Structured JSON with full experiment history
- **Backup:** Recommended to periodically back up this file
- **Privacy:** All data stays on your local machine

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Comparing AI Tools for Code Generation

```bash
# Log experiments with different tools
1. ChatGPT o1-preview - Rating: 5 - Tag: "code-generation"
2. Claude Sonnet 3.5 - Rating: 5 - Tag: "code-generation"
3. Gemini Pro - Rating: 3 - Tag: "code-generation"

# View statistics
Use get_statistics tool to see average ratings by tool

# Result: ChatGPT o1-preview and Claude tied at 5.0 avg rating
```

### Workflow 2: Tracking Prompt Engineering Improvements

```bash
# Log multiple iterations of the same task
Prompt v1: "Write a blog post about AI" → Rating: 2
Prompt v2: "Write a 500-word blog post about AI ethics for general audience" → Rating: 4
Prompt v3: "Write a 500-word blog post about AI ethics. Include real-world examples, counterarguments, and a strong conclusion. Target: general tech-savvy audience." → Rating: 5

# Tag all with "prompt-engineering" and "blog-writing"
# Review over time to identify what makes prompts effective
```

### Workflow 3: Finding Best Tool for Specific Tasks

```bash
# Tag experiments by task type
Tags: "creative-writing", "technical-writing", "code-review", "research"

# Use web dashboard to filter by tag
# Compare average ratings across tools for each category
# Make informed decisions about tool selection
```

## API Reference (Web Server)

If you're building integrations, the web server provides REST endpoints:

### POST /api/experiments

Create a new experiment

```json
{
  "aiTool": "ChatGPT",
  "prompt": "Your prompt",
  "result": "Summary of result",
  "rating": 4,
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

### GET /api/experiments

List experiments with optional query params:

- `searchQuery` - Full-text search
- `aiTool` - Filter by tool name
- `rating` - Filter by rating (1-5)
- `dateFrom` / `dateTo` - Date range filter

### GET /api/experiments/:id

Get specific experiment

### PUT /api/experiments/:id

Update experiment (send partial data)

### DELETE /api/experiments/:id

Delete experiment

### GET /api/statistics

Get comprehensive statistics

### GET /api/export

Download CSV export

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Web server port (default: 3000)
PORT=3000

# Data storage directory (default: ~/.ai-experiment-logger)
DATA_DIR=/custom/path/to/data
```

### Customization

You can modify the source code to:

- Add custom fields to experiments
- Create new statistics visualizations
- Implement additional filtering options
- Integrate with external analytics tools

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Appearing

1. Check the absolute path in `mcp_config.json` is correct
2. Verify the build completed: `ls dist/index.js`
3. Check Claude Code logs for error messages
4. Restart Claude Code completely

### Web Server Won't Start

1. Check port 3000 is not in use: `lsof -i :3000`
2. Verify dependencies installed: `pnpm install`
3. Check build succeeded: `pnpm build`
4. Try a different port: `PORT=8080 pnpm web`

### Data Not Persisting

1. Check permissions on `~/.ai-experiment-logger/` directory
2. Verify JSON file is writable
3. Look for error messages in console output
4. Try manually creating the directory: `mkdir -p ~/.ai-experiment-logger`
