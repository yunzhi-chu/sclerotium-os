# claude-code-slack-channel v0.9.1

Two-way Slack ↔ Claude Code bridge. Chat with Claude from Slack DMs and channels, just like you'd chat in the terminal. Per-thread session isolation, hash-chained tamper-evident audit journal with optional per-channel Slack projection, policy-gated tools, five-layer prompt-injection defense.

> **Research Preview** — Channels require Claude Code v2.1.80+ and `claude.ai` login.

## How It Works

```
Slack workspace (cloud)
    ↕ WebSocket (Socket Mode — outbound only, no public URL)
server.ts (local MCP server, spawned by Claude Code)
    ↕ stdio (MCP transport)
Claude Code session
```

Socket Mode means **no public URL needed** — works behind firewalls, NAT, anywhere.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → From scratch
2. **Socket Mode**: Settings → Socket Mode → Enable → Generate App-Level Token (`xapp-...`) with `connections:write` scope
3. **Event Subscriptions**: Enable → Subscribe to bot events:
   - `message.im` — DMs
   - `message.channels` — public channels
   - `message.groups` — private channels
   - `app_mention` — @ mentions
4. **Bot Token Scopes** (OAuth & Permissions):
   - `chat:write` — send messages
   - `channels:history` — read public channels
   - `groups:history` — read private channels
   - `im:history` — read DMs
   - `reactions:write` — add reactions
   - `files:read` — download shared files
   - `files:write` — upload files
   - `users:read` — resolve display names
5. **Install to Workspace** → Copy Bot Token (`xoxb-...`)

### 2. Configure Tokens

```bash
/slack-channel:configure xoxb-your-bot-token xapp-your-app-token
```

### 3. Run

Pick your runtime:

#### Option A: Bun (recommended)

```bash
bun install
# Current (claude-code-plugins marketplace):
claude --channels plugin:slack-channel@claude-code-plugins
# Future (after upstream approval):
# claude --channels plugin:slack-channel@claude-plugins-official
```

#### Option B: Node.js / npx

```bash
npm install
# In .mcp.json, change command to: "npx", args: ["tsx", "server.ts"]
claude --channels plugin:slack-channel@claude-code-plugins
```

#### Option C: Docker

```bash
docker build -t claude-slack-channel .
# In .mcp.json, change command to: "docker", args: ["run", "--rm", "-i", "-v", "~/.claude/channels/slack:/state", "claude-slack-channel"]
claude --channels plugin:slack-channel@claude-code-plugins
```

### 4. Pair Your Account

1. DM the bot in Slack — you'll get a 6-character pairing code
2. In your terminal: `/slack-channel:access pair <code>`
3. You're connected. Chat away.

## Policy Engine (v0.6.0+)

Author rules in `access.json.policy` to automate permission decisions for Claude Code tool calls. Three rule effects, first-applicable ordering:

```json
{
  "policy": [
    {
      "id": "safe-reads-in-ops",
      "effect": "auto_approve",
      "match": { "tool": "Read", "channel": "C_OPS_DOCS" }
    },
    {
      "id": "no-shell",
      "effect": "deny",
      "match": { "tool": "Bash" },
      "reason": "Shell execution is not permitted."
    },
    {
      "id": "dangerous-writes",
      "effect": "require_approval",
      "match": { "tool": "Write", "channel": "C_DEPLOY" },
      "approvers": 2,
      "ttlMs": 300000
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`auto_approve`** — skip the Block Kit prompt; the tool call runs immediately and a `policy.allow` event is journaled.
- **`deny`** — the reason is posted back into the originating thread and the call is rejected. `policy.deny` is journaled.
- **`require_approval`** — route through human approver(s). `approvers: 2` requires two **distinct** Slack `user_id`s (NIST two-person integrity; the same user cannot double-satisfy quorum by clicking twice). A single deny from any allowlisted user rejects the request immediately regardless of quorum count.
- Successful approvals grant a TTL window scoped to `(rule, channel, thread)` so a chain of similar calls doesn't re-prompt.
- Parse errors in `access.json.policy` are **fatal at boot** — policy is safety-critical, silent degradation is not offered. Missing or empty `policy` is fine (first-install path).

Full schema reference: [`ACCESS.md`](ACCESS.md#policy-rules). Decision procedure: `000-docs/policy-evaluation-flow.md`. Release scope and what was deliberately deferred: `000-docs/v0.6.0-release-plan.md`.

## Access Control

See [ACCESS.md](ACCESS.md) for the full schema.

```bash
/slack-channel:access policy allowlist       # Only pre-approved users
/slack-channel:access add U12345678          # Add a user
/slack-channel:access remove U12345678       # Remove a user
/slack-channel:access channel C12345678      # Opt in a channel
/slack-channel:access channel C12345678 --mention  # Require @mention
/slack-channel:access status                 # Show current config
```

### Multi-agent coordination

Channels can opt in to cross-bot message delivery by listing trusted bot user IDs in `allowBotIds`. Useful when multiple Claude Code instances (or other bots you operate) need to coordinate in a shared channel — e.g., an ops-monitor agent and an engineering agent in `#incidents`. Default is no cross-bot delivery: every bot message is dropped at the gate. See [ACCESS.md](ACCESS.md) for the full schema and security tradeoffs.

Example `access.json` entry:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "C_INCIDENTS": {
      "requireMention": false,
      "allowFrom": ["U_OPS_BOT", "U_ENG_BOT", "U_HUMAN"],
      "allowBotIds": ["U_OPS_BOT", "U_ENG_BOT"]
    }
  }
}
```

Self-echoes from this bot are always filtered regardless of `allowBotIds`. Peer bots cannot approve permission prompts — the permission relay gates on the top-level `allowFrom`, not the channel policy.

## Security

- **Sender gating**: Every inbound message hits a gate. Ungated messages are silently dropped before reaching Claude.
- **Outbound gate**: Replies only work to channels that passed the inbound gate.
- **File exfiltration guard**: Cannot send `.env`, `access.json`, or other state files through the reply tool.
- **Prompt injection defense**: System instructions explicitly tell Claude to refuse pairing/access requests from Slack messages.
- **Bot filtering**: `bot_id` messages are dropped by default. Channels that host multiple cooperating agents can opt in to specific peers via `allowBotIds`; self-echoes are always filtered via `bot_id` / `bot_profile.app_id` / `user` triple-check.
- **Link unfurling disabled**: All outbound messages set `unfurl_links: false, unfurl_media: false`.
- **Token security**: `.env` is `chmod 0o600`, never logged, never in tool results.
- **Static mode**: Set `SLACK_ACCESS_MODE=static` to freeze access at boot (no runtime mutation).

## Development

```bash
# Dev mode (bypasses plugin allowlist):
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:slack
```
