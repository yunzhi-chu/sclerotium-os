## Executive Summary

The scanning-market-movers skill provides real-time detection and analysis of significant price movements and unusual volume patterns across cryptocurrency markets. By continuously monitoring thousands of assets, this skill identifies emerging opportunities (gainers, losers, volume spikes) before they become widely recognized, giving traders a time advantage in fast-moving markets.

**Key Value Proposition:**

- Detect market moves as they happen, not after
- Filter noise with configurable thresholds
- Correlate price action with volume confirmation
- Rank movers by significance for prioritization

**Dependencies:**
This skill depends on the `tracking-crypto-prices` skill from `market-price-tracker` plugin for underlying price data infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

### Pain Points

1. **Information Overload**: With 10,000+ cryptocurrencies, manually tracking significant moves is impossible
2. **Delayed Reaction**: Traditional watchlists only show assets you're already tracking
3. **False Signals**: Raw price changes without volume context lead to poor decisions
4. **Scattered Data**: Price, volume, and market cap data spread across multiple sources
5. **Alert Fatigue**: Most scanners trigger too many low-quality alerts

### Desired State

Traders receive timely, filtered notifications of significant market moves with:

- Configurable thresholds (% change, volume multiplier, market cap filters)
- Volume-confirmed price action
- Ranked results by significance score
- Historical context (was this move expected based on recent patterns?)

- Export to CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Include timestamp and scan parameters

### Nice to Have (Could Have)

#### US-7: Significance Scoring

**As a** trader
**I want to** see moves ranked by significance
**So that** I can prioritize the most important moves

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Composite score based on % change, volume ratio, market cap
- Configurable scoring weights
- Explanation of why a move scored highly

#### US-8: Alert Integration

**As a** trader
**I want to** receive alerts when significant moves occur
**So that** I don't have to constantly watch the scanner

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Threshold-based alerting
- Output suitable for piping to notification systems
- Rate limiting to prevent alert spam
