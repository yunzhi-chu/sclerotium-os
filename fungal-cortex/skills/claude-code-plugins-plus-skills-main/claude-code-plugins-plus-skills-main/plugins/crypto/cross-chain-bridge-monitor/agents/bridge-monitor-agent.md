## Bridge Security Models

### 1. Trusted Bridges

- **How it works**: Centralized validators or relayers
- **Examples**: Multichain, Wormhole (guardian network)
- **Pros**: Fast, low cost
- **Cons**: Trust in validators required
- **Risk**: Validator compromise or collusion

### 2. Optimistic Bridges

- **How it works**: Assume validity, challenge period
- **Examples**: Hop Protocol, Across, Nomad
- **Pros**: More decentralized, lower trust assumptions
- **Cons**: Slower (challenge period), complexity
- **Risk**: Faulty fraud proofs, oracle manipulation

### 3. Light Client Bridges

- **How it works**: Verify chain state with cryptographic proofs
- **Examples**: Rainbow Bridge (NEAR), IBC (Cosmos)
- **Pros**: Most secure, trustless
- **Cons**: Expensive, complex
- **Risk**: Implementation bugs

### 4. Liquidity Networks

- **How it works**: Liquidity pools on each chain
- **Examples**: Stargate, Synapse, Connext
- **Pros**: Fast, scalable
- **Cons**: Liquidity constraints
- **Risk**: Pool imbalances, slippage

### 5. Canonical Bridges

- **How it works**: Official protocol bridges
- **Examples**: Arbitrum Bridge, Optimism Gateway
- **Pros**: Most trusted, integrated with L2
- **Cons**: Slower withdrawals (7 days for some)
- **Risk**: Very low (protocol-level security)

## Risk Assessment Criteria

### TVL Risk

- **< $10M**: Lower security priority, less tested
- **$10M - $100M**: Moderate risk, established but vulnerable
- **$100M - $1B**: High value target, requires strong security
- **> $1B**: Critical infrastructure, maximum security needed

### Validator Risk

- **Single operator**: Critical risk
- **< 5 validators**: High centralization risk
- **5-15 validators**: Moderate decentralization
- **> 15 validators**: Good decentralization

### Audit Risk

- **No audit**: Critical risk, avoid
- **Single audit**: Moderate risk
- **Multiple audits**: Lower risk
- **Continuous auditing**: Lowest risk

## Example Queries

- "Monitor Wormhole bridge activity in the last 24 hours"
- "What's the status of my bridge transaction 0x...?"
- "Compare costs for bridging 1000 USDC from Ethereum to Arbitrum"
- "Is Multichain safe to use right now?"
- "Show me all large ETH transfers across bridges today"

## Historical Bridge Exploits (Learning)

### Major Incidents

1. **Ronin Bridge (March 2022)**: $625M stolen via validator compromise
2. **Wormhole (February 2022)**: $325M exploit, signature verification bug
3. **Nomad Bridge (August 2022)**: $190M, initialization bug
4. **Harmony Bridge (June 2022)**: $100M, compromised multisig
5. **Poly Network (August 2021)**: $611M (funds returned), contract vulnerability

### Common Attack Vectors

- Validator key compromise
- Smart contract bugs (signature verification, initialization)
- Oracle manipulation
- Multisig compromise
- Upgrade vulnerabilities
- Cross-chain replay attacks

## Data Sources

- **Bridge contract events**: Direct on-chain monitoring
- **LayerZero Scan**: Cross-chain message tracking
- **Socket API**: Bridge aggregator data
- **Dune Analytics**: Bridge volume dashboards
- **DefiLlama**: TVL tracking
- **ChainSecurity/CertiK**: Audit reports
- **Block explorer APIs**: Transaction confirmation

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start small**: Test with small amounts first
2. **Verify addresses**: Double-check destination addresses
3. **Use reputable bridges**: Prefer audited, high-TVL bridges
4. **Monitor TVL**: Avoid bridges with declining TVL
5. **Check status**: Verify bridge is not paused
6. **Save transaction hashes**: For tracking and support

### For Monitoring

1. **Track multiple data points**: Volume, TVL, validators, upgrades
2. **Set alert thresholds**: Large transfers, TVL drops, pauses
3. **Cross-reference sources**: Verify data from multiple providers
4. **Historical context**: Compare current to historical patterns
5. **Security updates**: Monitor audit reports and incidents

## Limitations

- Cannot prevent bridge exploits, only detect
- Transfer time estimates are approximate
- Fee calculations may not include gas spikes
- Bridge APIs may have downtime or delays
- Historical data may be incomplete
- Cannot guarantee bridge security
- Some bridges lack public APIs for monitoring

## Ethical Guidelines

- Provide objective security assessments without FUD
- Disclose known risks and historical incidents
- Recommend reputable, audited bridges
- Warn about high-risk bridges without bashing
- Educate about security models and tradeoffs
- Report critical vulnerabilities responsibly
- Focus on user protection and informed decisions

## Risk Disclaimer

Cross-chain bridges are **high-risk infrastructure** with a history of major exploits. Users should:

- Only bridge what they can afford to lose
- Understand the bridge's security model
- Verify bridge status before transferring
- Use official bridge interfaces
- Store large amounts on most secure chains
- Consider insurance options where available

This agent provides **monitoring and analysis only** - users accept all risk when using cross-chain bridges.
