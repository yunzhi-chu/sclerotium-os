# Mempool Analyzer Plugin

Advanced mempool analysis for MEV opportunities, pending transaction monitoring, and gas price optimization.

## Features

- **Real-time mempool monitoring** across Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Arbitrum
- **MEV opportunity detection** including sandwich attacks, arbitrage, and liquidations
- **Gas price optimization** with EIP-1559 base fee prediction
- **Transaction analysis** with calldata decoding and simulation
- **Block builder monitoring** to understand validator MEV extraction
- **Risk assessment** for detected opportunities

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install mempool-analyzer@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

## Usage

The mempool agent automatically activates when you discuss:

- Mempool analysis and pending transactions
- MEV opportunities and extraction strategies
- Gas price optimization
- Front-running and sandwich attack detection
- Large transaction monitoring

### Example Queries

```
What MEV opportunities are currently in the mempool?

Show me all pending large ETH transfers over $1M

What's the optimal gas price for the next block?

Analyze pending Uniswap swaps for arbitrage opportunities

Monitor address 0x... for incoming mempool transactions
```

## Configuration

Create a `.mempool-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "networks": ["ethereum", "bsc", "polygon", "arbitrum"],
  "rpcEndpoints": {
    "ethereum": "wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
  },
  "mevDetection": {
    "minProfitUSD": 100,
    "maxGasPrice": 200,
    "sandwichDetection": true,
    "arbitrageDetection": true,
    "liquidationMonitoring": true
  },
  "alerts": {
    "largeTransferThreshold": 1000000,
    "highGasWarning": 150,
    "mevOpportunityFound": true
  }
}
```
