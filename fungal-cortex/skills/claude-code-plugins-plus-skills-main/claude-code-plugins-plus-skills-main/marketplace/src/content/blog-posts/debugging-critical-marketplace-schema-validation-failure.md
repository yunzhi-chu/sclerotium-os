At 10:16 PM ET on October 16th, 2025, a user reported they couldn't install the Claude Code Plugins marketplace. The error message was clear but devastating:

```
✘ Failed to add marketplace: Invalid schema: plugins.1: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'enhances'
```

**Impact:** ZERO users could install the marketplace. Complete installation failure.

This is the story of how we debugged it, fixed it, added legal compliance, resolved CI/CD issues, and deployed security improvements - all in under 3 hours.

## The Investigation

### Step 1: Reproduce and Locate

The first step was understanding what "plugins.1" meant. I searched the marketplace catalogs:

```bash
grep -n "enhances" .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**Found it:** Line 59-62 in the `web-to-github-issue` plugin entry:

```json
"enhances": [
  "web_search",
  "web_fetch"
]
```

The problem? Claude Code's marketplace schema **doesn't support** the `enhances` field. This was a field I had added thinking it would be useful metadata, but the CLI rejected it completely.

### Step 2: The Two-Catalog Problem

Our marketplace has TWO catalog files:

1. **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json`** - Source of truth (website metadata)
2. **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** - Generated CLI catalog (strict schema)

I had manually edited `marketplace.json` to remove `enhances`, but our CI workflow regenerates this file from the extended catalog. The fix needed to be in BOTH places.

**Lesson learned:** Manual edits to generated files = recipe for CI failures.

### Step 3: Fix and Regenerate

```bash
# Remove from source catalog
vim .claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json
# (deleted the enhances field)

# Regenerate CLI catalog
node scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs
```

Output:

```
✅ Synced CLI marketplace catalog -> .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

### Step 4: Validate JSON

```bash
jq empty .claude-plugin/marketplace.json && \
jq empty .claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json && \
echo "✓ Both JSON files are valid"
```

```
✓ Both JSON files are valid
```

Perfect! But pushing to GitHub triggered another problem...

## The CI/CD False Positive

GitHub Actions security scan failed:

```
❌ ERROR: Private key detected!
plugins/examples/skills-powerkit/skills/plugin-auditor/SKILL.md:- ❌ No private keys (BEGIN PRIVATE KEY)
plugins/examples/skills-powerkit/skills/plugin-validator/SKILL.md:- ❌ No private keys (BEGIN PRIVATE KEY)
```

Wait, what? These are **documentation files** explaining what patterns to look for during security audits. They're not actual private keys!

### The Problem

Our security scan excluded `README.md` files from private key detection, but not `SKILL.md` files:

```yaml
# Before
PRIVATE_KEYS=$(grep -r "BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY" plugins/ 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -v "README.md" | grep -v "Pattern:" || true)
```

### The Fix

```yaml
# After
PRIVATE_KEYS=$(grep -r "BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY" plugins/ 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -v "README.md" | grep -v "SKILL.md" | grep -v "Pattern:" || true)
```

**Lesson learned:** Security scans need context. Documentation about security patterns ≠ actual security violations.

## The Legal Compliance Addition

While fixing the critical bug, the user reminded me of an outstanding legal requirement: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy pages.

**User's exact words:** "this of legal importance update all my websites make sure this is oresent dtafg with claude code plugins"

### Implementation: GetTerms.io Integration

Instead of writing legal documents from scratch (dangerous!), we used GetTerms.io - a service that maintains professionally-written, legally-compliant documents.

**Three new Astro pages created:**

```typescript
// marketplace/src/pages/terms.astro
<div class="getterms-document-embed"
     data-getterms="wH2cn"  // Account ID
     data-getterms-document="terms-of-service"
     data-getterms-lang="en-us"
     data-getterms-mode="direct"
     data-getterms-env="https://gettermscdn.com">
</div>
```

Similar structure for `/privacy` and `/acceptable-use`.

### Styling Dynamic Content

The challenge? GetTerms.io injects HTML dynamically, which Astro's scoped styles don't reach.

**Solution:** Use `:global()` selectors:

```css
.getterms-document-embed :global(h2) {
  color: var(--green-400);
  font-size: 1.75rem;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}

.getterms-document-embed :global(a) {
  color: var(--green-400);
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Footer Integration

Added legal links to every page:

```astro
<div class="footer-section">
  <h4 class="footer-heading">Legal</h4>
  <ul class="footer-links">
    <li><a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a></li>
    <li><a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

**Result:** 7 total pages deployed (was 4).

## The X/Twitter Warning

After deployment, the user reported: "when a user clicks my link in an x oost it says ny site isnt safe go back"

This is a common issue with **new domains**. X/Twitter flags domains without trust signals as potentially unsafe.

### The Problem

`claudecodeplugins.io` was deployed the same day. New domain + no security headers = X flags it.

### The Fix: Security Headers via Meta Tags

GitHub Pages doesn't let you set HTTP headers, but you can use meta tags:

```html
<!-- Security Headers (via meta tags for GitHub Pages) -->
<meta http-equiv="X-Content-Type-Options" content="nosniff" />
<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="SAMEORIGIN" />
<meta http-equiv="Referrer-Policy" content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" />
<meta http-equiv="Permissions-Policy" content="geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()" />
```

### Enhanced Twitter Cards

```html
<!-- Twitter -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@jeremylongshore" />
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@jeremylongshore" />
```

**Expected timeline:**

- Short term (1-7 days): Some users may still see warnings
- Long term: Domain builds trust, warnings disappear

## Deployment Timeline

Here's how fast we moved once the bug was identified:

```
10:16 PM ET - User reports installation failure
10:44 PM ET - Fix committed (failed: npm cache issue)
10:45 PM ET - Catalog sync (failed: security scan false positive)
10:46 PM ET - Security scan fix (passed ✅)
10:47 PM ET - Manual marketplace deployment (passed ✅)
```

**Total time from bug report to fix deployed:** 31 minutes.

## The Release

All changes documented in CHANGELOG.md as v1.0.43:

```markdown
## [1.0.43] - 2025-10-16

### 🎉 Highlights

**🚨 CRITICAL MARKETPLACE FIX + Legal Compliance**

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

**Marketplace Installation Blocker (HIGH SEVERITY)**
- Error: Invalid schema: plugins.1: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'enhances'
- Impact: NO users could install marketplace
- Fix: Removed unsupported field from both marketplace catalogs
```

**Git tags created:**

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.43 -m "Release v1.0.43: Critical marketplace fix + legal compliance"
git push origin v1.0.43
```

## What I Learned

### 1. Schema Validation is Binary

One invalid field = complete failure. There's no partial success, no warnings - just "NO."

**Takeaway:** Validate against schemas religiously, especially for public APIs.

### 2. Two-Catalog Systems Need Discipline

Our extended catalog is the source of truth. The CLI catalog is generated. Never manually edit generated files.

**Solution:** Added CI step that fails if catalogs are out of sync:

```yaml
- name: Sync CLI marketplace catalog
  run: |
    node scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs
    if ! git diff --quiet .claude-plugin/marketplace.json; then
      echo "Marketplace CLI catalog was out of date"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 3. Security Scans Need Context

A security scan that flags documentation about security patterns is a false positive generator.

**Better approach:** Use exclusion patterns thoughtfully:

- Exclude documentation files (README.md, SKILL.md)
- Exclude "Pattern:" mentions (indicating examples)
- Still catch actual secrets

### 4. Legal Compliance is Non-Negotiable

When users say "this of legal importance," they mean it. GetTerms.io saved hours of legal research and potential liability.

### 5. New Domains Need Trust Signals

X/Twitter, Google, and other platforms flag new domains aggressively. Security headers help, but time builds trust.

**Immediate actions:**

- Add security meta tags
- Submit for manual review
- Get organic engagement (each "Continue" click helps)

## Final Results

**Before This Session:**

- ❌ ZERO users could install marketplace
- ❌ Schema validation error on installation
- ❌ No legal pages (Terms, Privacy, Acceptable Use)
- ❌ CI security scan had false positives
- ❌ No security headers for X/Twitter

**After This Session:**

- ✅ Marketplace installation works for all users
- ✅ Schema validation passes
- ✅ Full legal compliance with embedded policies
- ✅ CI/CD passing without false positives
- ✅ Security headers deployed
- ✅ 7 pages deployed to claudecodeplugins.io

**Installation now works:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins
✅ Success! Marketplace added
```
