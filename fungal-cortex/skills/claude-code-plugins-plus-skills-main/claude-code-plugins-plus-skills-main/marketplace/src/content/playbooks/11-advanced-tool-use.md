<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Advanced tool use transforms Claude from a simple function-calling agent into an intelligent orchestrator capable of working with hundreds of tools, processing massive datasets, and executing complex multi-step workflows. Anthropic's three beta features—<strong>Tool Search Tool</strong>, <strong>Programmatic Tool Calling</strong>, and <strong>Tool Use Examples</strong>—solve the fundamental bottlenecks preventing production-scale agent deployments.</p>

<p>Traditional tool calling hits three critical walls: context bloat from loading tool definitions (55K+ tokens for basic MCP setups), context pollution from intermediate results (50KB+ of expense data for simple budget checks), and inference overhead (19+ separate model calls for 20-tool workflows). Advanced tool use eliminates these bottlenecks with dynamic tool discovery, code-based orchestration, and example-driven parameter guidance.</p>

<p>This playbook provides production implementation patterns for building agents that scale to enterprise tool libraries, handle multi-step research workflows, and process large datasets without context exhaustion.</p>
