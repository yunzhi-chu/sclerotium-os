# Awesome Hermes Agent

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A hand-picked collection of skills, plugins, tools, integrations, and community resources for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) — the self-evolving AI agent from [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).

Hermes Agent is built around a closed learning loop — it generates skills from real experience, improves them while working, and starting from v0.12.0 runs an autonomous Curator that scores, merges, and prunes the skill library on a weekly cron cycle. It builds a growing model of who you are across sessions and retains that context persistently. You can host it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or one of seven serverless backends (Vercel Sandbox, Daytona, Modal, and more). Access it through any of 18 built-in messaging platforms — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Feishu/Lark, WeCom, QQBot, Yuanbao, and others — plus Microsoft Teams through a plugin.

This list tracks the ecosystem building around it.

**See also:** [awesome-openclaw](https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/awesome-openclaw) — curated resources for OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot / Clawdbot), the predecessor agent with a native Hermes migration path.

## Where Do I Start?

If you're new to Hermes, start small instead of installing everything at once:

1. **Get it running** — Work through the [Official Docs quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/). It walks you through installation, CLI usage, configuration, and your first conversation.
2. **Install your first skills** — [wondelai/skills](https://github.com/wondelai/skills) (380+ stars, actively maintained) is a cross-platform skills library that works with Hermes and other agents. Or pick up [litprog-skill](https://github.com/tlehman/litprog-skill) (75+ stars) if you want literate programming support across Hermes, Claude Code, and OpenCode.
3. **Get a GUI** — [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) (500+ stars) is a Hermes-native workspace with chat, terminal, and a skills manager. If you need multi-agent fleet management, [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) (3.7k+ stars) handles task dispatch and cost tracking at scale.

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore the full list below. Every resource carries a maturity label:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **production** | Stable, documented, actively maintained — safe to build on |
| **beta** | Works but still changing — expect some rough edges |
| **experimental** | Proof of concept or early-stage — informative, not dependable |

## Operational Playbooks

> Workflow patterns that repeatedly help Hermes teams in production.

- **Nightly self-evolution with guardrails** — Run [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) on a schedule, then add a second verification cron that scores quality and blocks optimization-loop gaming.
- **Managing memory pressure** — If you're losing long-term recall or repeating context, review the [Honcho memory docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/honcho) and evaluate [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) or self-hosted memory backends.
- **Configure session timeout and expiry early** — Use the [configuration docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration/) to tune session retention for slower-moving threads before you need it.
- **Side-by-side OpenClaw migration** — Keep both systems running during migration using [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) and native Hermes migration paths. Cut over once cron and routing behavior match.
- **Treat USER.md and MEMORY.md as infrastructure** — Keep entries concise, durable, and preference-focused rather than raw notes. High signal beats high volume.

---

## Level-Up Blueprints

> Opinionated stacks for getting more from Hermes quickly.

- **Memory that compounds** — Start with Hermes built-in memory. Add [honcho-self-hosted](https://github.com/elkimek/honcho-self-hosted) for stronger cross-session user modeling, [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) for retain/recall/reflect workflows across large histories, and [plur](https://github.com/plur-ai/plur) for portable shared memory in an open engram format. Pair with [flowstate-qmd](https://github.com/amassing3390/flowstate-qmd) for proactive context pre-loading.
- **Self-improvement without drift** — Pair [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) with scheduled regression checks and [lintlang](https://github.com/roli-lpci/lintlang) for prompt and config linting. The goal isn't "evolve faster" — it's "evolve without quietly getting weird."
- **Operator cockpit for real work** — Use [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) for daily use, [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) for multi-agent fleet visibility and cost tracking, and [hermes-webui](https://github.com/sanchomuzax/hermes-webui) for a lighter ops surface.
- **Multi-agent execution layer** — Combine Hermes delegation with [hermes-agent-acp-skill](https://github.com/Rainhoole/hermes-agent-acp-skill) for Codex/Claude Code routing, [zouroboros-swarm-executors](https://github.com/marlandoj/zouroboros-swarm-executors) for local executor handoff, and [bigiron](https://github.com/supermodeltools/bigiron) for specialized agent roles.
- **Migration and deployment hardening** — Keep [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) in the toolkit even if you prefer the native migration path. For repeatable deploys: [nix-hermes-agent](https://github.com/0xrsydn/nix-hermes-agent), [hermes-agent-docker](https://github.com/xmbshwll/hermes-agent-docker), or [evey-setup](https://github.com/42-evey/evey-setup) depending on how opinionated you want the stack.
- **Paperclip-governed ops** — For teams running Hermes inside a governed company workflow, combine [hermes-paperclip-adapter](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-paperclip-adapter) with Hermes cron and one of the operator dashboards. That gives you task governance and operational continuity rather than a clever demo that forgets what it was doing.
