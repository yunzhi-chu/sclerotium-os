- **Local LLM support** via Ollama and LM Studio (run DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- **Persistent memory** across sessions — remembers context and preferences
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** support for extended agentic capabilities
- **Multi-provider** — Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or any local model

## Security

### Best Practices

- Run OpenClaw in a sandboxed environment to limit blast radius
- Restrict file system access to only necessary directories
- Store API keys in environment variables — never hardcode them
- Keep OpenClaw updated to the latest version
- Review skills before installing from third-party sources
- Never expose your OpenClaw instance to the public internet

### Security Tools

| Project | Stars | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| [aquaman](https://github.com/tech4242/aquaman) | - | Credential isolation proxy — API keys never enter the agent process, injected via UDS from Keychain/1Password/Vault/keepassxc |
| [APort Agent Guardrails](https://github.com/aporthq/aport-agent-guardrails) | - | Pre-action authorization for OpenClaw; `before_tool_call` plugin, allowlist + 40+ blocked patterns, local or API. Setup: `npx @aporthq/agent-guardrails` |
| [leashed](https://github.com/dormstern/leashed) | - | Policy engine, audit log, and kill switch for AI agents. Allow/deny patterns, time limits, and emergency revocation. |
| [OneCLI](https://github.com/onecli/onecli) | - | Open-source credential vault for AI agents. Rust HTTP gateway injects API keys transparently so agents never handle raw secrets. Per-agent scoped tokens, AES-256-GCM encryption at rest. |
| [ClawLens](https://github.com/nk3750/clawlens) | - | Local-first observability and guardrails for OpenClaw agents — records every tool call before execution, scores risky behavior, keeps a tamper-evident hash-chain audit trail, and turns observed actions into block / require-approval / allow-notify guardrails delivered to Telegram. |
| [iClaw](https://github.com/iclawapp/iclaw) | - | Local-first AI workspace with sandboxed file execution — isolates files in containers, detects malware and credential theft before execution. npm: @iclawapp/iclaw |

### Known Risks

- Exposed instances can be commandeered by adversaries
- Prompt injection via malicious content in ingested data
- Misconfigured setups may leak sensitive data or API keys

## FAQ

**What is OpenClaw?**
OpenClaw is a free, open-source, self-hosted AI agent created by Peter Steinberger (formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot). It runs locally on your computer and connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and 12+ other messaging platforms.

**How is OpenClaw different from ChatGPT?**
OpenClaw is self-hosted (runs on your own machine), open-source, supports any AI model (including local models via Ollama), and integrates with real-world tools like GitHub, Gmail, and smart home devices. ChatGPT is a cloud service operated by OpenAI.

**Does OpenClaw work with local LLMs?**
Yes. OpenClaw supports Ollama and LM Studio, letting you run models like DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, and others entirely offline without sending data to any cloud service.

**What is the difference between Clawdbot, Moltbot, and OpenClaw?**
All three names refer to the same project. It started as Clawdbot, was renamed to Moltbot, and eventually became OpenClaw as it went fully open-source.

**Is OpenClaw free?**
Yes. OpenClaw is MIT licensed and completely free to use. You only pay for any AI API calls you make (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic), or you can run it fully free with local models via Ollama.

**How do I install OpenClaw?**
Run `npm install -g openclaw@latest` then `openclaw onboard` to start the setup wizard. See the [Installation Guides](#installation-guides) section for platform-specific guides.
